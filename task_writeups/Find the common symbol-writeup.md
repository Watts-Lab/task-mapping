Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Each participant is given a set of five symbols. For each participant, four of their five symbols are different from those of the other participants, and only one of the symbols is common among everyone. Participants cannot see each others' symbols, but they can send messages to one another.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The task is to work together to find the common symbol, and to do so (1) as quickly as possible; (2) with as few communications/messages as possible; and (3) with as few mistakes as possible.
