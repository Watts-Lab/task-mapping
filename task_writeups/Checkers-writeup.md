# Checkers

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given an online checkers board. This is an 8x8 board, in which the squares are colored dark and white in alternating colors. Participants start out with 12 round, flat pieces on each side; these are placed on the dark squares on their side of the board.

The rules of checkers are as follows: 

1. The two sides take turns playing. One side completes a move, and then the other side plays.
2. You can only move a piece diagonally across the board (the game uses only the dark squares). 
3. A piece can only move diagonally into a square where there are no existing pieces.
4. Pieces can only move forward (the only exception is rule #6).
5. You can take (or "capture") your opponent's pieces by moving diagonally, jumping over the piece being captured, and landing on an unoccupied square. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn by jumping forward several times in a row.
6. If a piece reaches the other side, it becomes a "king" and has an additional piece stacked on top of it. Kings have the additional ability to jump backwards.
7. The game ends when one party loses all of its pieces (everything is captured).

Participants control one side of the board, and a computer controls the other side. When playing as a team, participants discuss their strategy and make their next move together.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to win --- to beat the computer (the opponent) in checkers. This involves capturing all of the computer's checkers pieces by following the rules of the game. Participants need to win the game within a fixed time limit, or else they automatically lose.
