# Ultimatum game (various versions)

Mapped by: sky1113 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are placed into pairs and randomly assigned the role of "proposer" or "responder." The proposer will receive an endowment that they may split with the responder. The proposer will make a decision as to how they would like to split it, which is then shared with the responder. The responder can then choose to either accept or reject. If accepted, the sum is split as was proposed, but if rejected, both players receive nothing. Players are made aware of the payoff arrangement prior to making their decisions. The same pairs play together for a predetermined number of rounds and roles are reassigned each round.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant has the goal of maximizing their earnings. In the proposer role, participants must consider how much they should offer in order to keep as much as possible while ensuring the offer will still be accepted. In the responder role, participants must consider how they will respond to "unfair" or "low" proposals and the impact this will have on their payoff in the remaining rounds. Both must also consider their reputation and relationship with their partner throughout the game and the impact of these factors on their earnings. Participants must also make their proposals and response decisions in a fixed amount of time.
