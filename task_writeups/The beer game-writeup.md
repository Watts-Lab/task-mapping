# The beer game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are assigned to a group of four, in which each player has a different role: (1) retailer, (2) wholesaler, (3) distributor, and (4) factory. Customer demand (in kegs of beer) arises only at the retailer, which replenishes its inventory from the wholesaler; the wholesaler gets its beer from the distributor; and the distributor gets its beer from the factory, which produces the beer. The customer demand in different periods is a random variable, independently drawn from a distribution that is known to all players. The beer flows upstream to downstream (i.e. from the factory, to the distribution center, to the warehouse, and finally to the retail store). In contrast, the information about the customers' orders flows in the opposite direction (it goes from the retail store back up to the factory). Both the material and information flows are subject to delays. For example, there is an order processing delay, or information lead time, between when an order is placed and when the supplier receives the order.

Here is an example. Suppose the retail store orders 10 kegs from the warehouse on Monday. The warehouse receives this order on Wednesday. This information delay is due to the administrative steps in processing an order. On Wednesday, however, the warehouse only has 5 kegs of beer, so it ships 5 kegs to the retail store and backlogs the remaining 5. This shipment of 5 kegs arrives at the retail store on Friday. This delay is due to transportation.

In each period, the channel members must decide how much, if any, beer to order from their respective suppliers. The factory must decide how much, if any, beer to produce.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to minimize the total holding and backorder costs incurred in the entire supply chain and optimize the system-wide performance. In other words, the goal is to for each member to choose the right amount of beer to order or produce, despite the lag in information. If participants get the number wrong, they suffer a penalty. If they have too much beer, the wholesaler, distributor, and factory suffer a "holding cost," because it is expensive to store the extra inventory. If they have too little beer, the retailer suffers a "backorder cost," because it is expensive to lose customers when the store does not have the beer people want. In an ideal world, if the entire supply chain operates perfectly smoothly, the cost incurred would be zero.
