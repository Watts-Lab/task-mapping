# Recall word lists

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants hear about a list of words. For example, they could listen to a tape of a male voice reading several words at the rate of one word per second.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to remember the list of words and then write down as many words from the list as possible. 

Participants are required to start their list with the last word they heard, or else it is not counted. Otherwise, words can be written in any order. Participants have a limited amount of time to recall all the words they can.

The maximum score occurs if participants recall all words correctly. They get zero points for recalling no words, or for failing to start the list with the final word. Participants lose points for incorrectly recalling words that were not on the list. If working in a team, participants can collaborate to submit the final list of recalled words.
