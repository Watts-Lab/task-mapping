# Whac-A-Mole

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex
Participants see a shared screen with a bunch of colored moving targets (circles) and an ability to click or "hit" the targets as they moved around. Each participant can control their own individual mouse, but everyone sees the same moving targets.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The targets are worth different numbers of points based on their color. Participants' goal was to hit (e.g., click on) targets based on their point value, thereby maximizing their points. They have a limited amount of time to get as many points as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Reaction

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
