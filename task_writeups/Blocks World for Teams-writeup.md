# Blocks World for Teams

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants work together in a virtual world to complete a search-and-deliver task. There are nine rooms, designated A1 through C3, and each room contains various colored blocks. A 10th room, designated the "drop zone," is located at the bottom of the map. 

A special sequence of colored blocks is depicted below the "drop zone." We can call this special sequence the "target sequence," and it represents the blocks that participants will bring from the main rooms into the drop zone.

In addition to the 10 rooms, there are hallways allowing participants to travel from room to room. Each participant controls an avatar and can move their avatar to pick up a block. The participant then navigates to the drop zone to successfully deliver the block. If the participant delivers a block into the drop zone that is not of the requested color, this incorrect block would be automatically and randomly placed into one of the other nine rooms.

As they move from room to room, participants are only able to see a limited amount of information. For example, they are only able to see the blocks in the room they are currently occupying, and they are not able to see their teammates. However, participants can see whether or not an adjacent room is occupied.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to deliver the correct sequence of colored blocks (the target sequence) from the virtual rooms to the drop zone. Participants should complete the task as quickly as possible, as well as finish within a limited amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
communication skills, coordination skills, analytical skills, reasoning skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
To move an avatar a participant can right-click anywhere in the environment (i.e., rooms or hallways) and then select "go here" from a menu of options that subsequently appeared. To pick up a block, a participant can enter a room using his or her avatar and typed the first letter of the block color (e.g., "b" for a blue block or "r" for a red block). The participant then enters the drop zone and types the letter "d" to successfully deliver the block.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants are able to communicate with all of their teammates simultaneously or with individual team members using the communications available to them in the interface. For example, when participants click on communication, a dropdown menu is available to them to send the message to a specific participant ("Avatar 1," "Avatar 2," "Avatar 3," and "Avatar 4") or "Everyone" to broadcast the message globally. When participants click on a communication message that has a bolded item (e.g., "ROOM," "BLOCK"), a multilevel drop-down menu appeared. This allows participants to first select the participant to whom they want to send the message, then room or block identification information.
