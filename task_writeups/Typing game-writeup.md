# Typing game

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see an image of a document ---  we can call this the "Document to Copy." This document contains several passages of relatively complicated text.

The Document to Copy cannot be edited, copied, or pasted. Everyone working together sees the same document.

Participants also have a shared, editable document, where they are able to type.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to exactly reproduce the words from the Document to Copy in the editable document. The focus is on typing words correctly: participants earn points for every word they correctly type, and they lose points for skipping words or for making typos.

Participants have a limited amount of time to type as many words from the Document to Copy as they can.

If working in a group, everyone types into the same shared document, and therefore team members must also coordinate to avoid typing over each other or missing certain sections.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
