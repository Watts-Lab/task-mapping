# Estimating social quantity

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a series of questions on estimating quantities of real-life social phenomena. For example, participants can be asked to estimate the median age in the U.S. in 2009.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to answer a series of questions within a fixed amount of time as close to the correct answer as possible without looking up the solutions.

Participants are evaluated based on the percent difference of their estimation from the correct answer. Participants receive the maximum score if their estimation is exactly like the correct answer and the percent difference between them is 0. Participants maximize their score by submitting an estimation that is as close to the right answer as possible. For example, because the median age in the U.S. in 2009 is 36.7, participants get the maximum score if their estimation is 36.7, while an estimation of 35 years receives a higher score than an estimation of 30 years.
