# Splitting a deck of cards

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are shown cards from a standard deck, one by one. As the participants see the cards, they are told whether the card belongs to a "rule" or not.

From the instructions, participants know that there is a rule dividing the 52 cards into two categories, but they do not know what the rule is. The rule can be based on numerical value of cards; their color, suit, logical connectives, alternation, or any combination of these. For example, a rule could be "the card is divisible by 3," or "two black cards and one red card alternate."

The fist card card shown is always an example of the rule (it's an exemplar). As participants see more cards, they will see some exemplars, and some cards that do not belong to the rule (non-exemplars).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to correctly figure out the rule dividing the deck of cards in as few trials as possible and within a fixed amount of time.

As participant keep seeing new cards one-by-one, they make proposals as to what the rule is and receive immediate feedback. Cards that have been shown get sorted into exemplars and non-exemplars and stay in front of participants so that they can see patterns. To get a better score on the task, participants have to understand what the pattern is as fast as they can.
