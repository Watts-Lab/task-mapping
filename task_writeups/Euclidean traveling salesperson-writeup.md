# Euclidean traveling salesperson

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different "paths" by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a "path" between A and B. All participants, who are working on individual screens, are shown a shared map of the cities and can click and interact with it simultaneously.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to find and select the precise shortest path through the cities within a fixed amount of time. This is the sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a "traveling salesman" who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant's goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.

Participants are evaluated on how close the path they found was to the optimal shortest path. They will be able to see the length of the current path they found, but they will not be told that they have reached the optimum.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Creative thinking, analytical thinking

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Clicking city icons in order select the "path," with the ability to select the next segment only after the previous segment had been selected,
Viewing previous solutions to the problem (optional),
Attempting the same map multiple times (optional),
Viewing a score of how well they are currently doing (optional),
Attempting multiple different maps, in sequence.

### Other Allowed Processes
In multiplayer mode, there can be multiple ways to implement the experience: it is possible for all players to look at the same map and select paths simultaneously; perhaps the system could then submit the best answer. hk_f18a61939eed6861, only one person would be able to select the pathway at a time.
