# Run a mini business

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given information on running a tinker toy manufacturing company. The information is organized in the form of specialized tables that have parameters for the tinker toys, as well as details on assembling different models, order forms, costs, and prices. In addition, the tables reflect how costs and selling prices fluctuate over time.

Participants can view these tables and run their business through an interface on the computer. In the beginning, participants are given a base pay to start off their business. As participants play, they can lose and gain money.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to make as large a profit as possible from running the business for a fixed amount of time.

Based on the information provided to them, participants can "buy" parts, "manufacture" products, and "sell" them at the price they determine. Participants are evaluated based on how much money they have by the end of the game's time limit. The less money they lose and the more money they make, the more successful their performance is on the task.
