# Biopharm Seltek

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired for a negotiation about the sale of a biotechnology plant. Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the buyer, the CFO of BioPharm, or the seller, the CFO of Seltek. BioPharm needs to either buy or build a plant to produce a genetically engineered antibiotic compound called Depox. Depox is a promising pharmaceutical product, and BioPharm needs a plant with special manufacturing equipment. There are two choices for BioPharm: (1) build a new plant; (2) buy a plant that is already set up to manufacture genetically engineered compounds. For this second option, Seltek seems like an ideal "turnkey" facility. BioPharm possesses public information about Seltek, including previous appraisal value, accounting statements, and so on. Meanwhile, Seltek is a medium-sized pharmaceutical company that (unbeknownst to BioPharm) has been struggling financially, and it is desperate to sell both the plant and the patent for its chemical compound. Seltek possesses detailed information about its own financial state, and also knows basic information about BioPharm from public documents.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of each party is to reach an agreement that is as beneficial as possible for their own side. In other words, Biopharm should buy the plant for as low a price as possible, and Seltek should sell the plant for as high a price as possible. Since each side possesses different information, participants must strategically share (or choose to withhold) what they know in order to get a good deal. For example, if Seltek divulges the information that they are desperate to sell, they would likely obtain a much lower price than if they did not divulge such information.

There are two possible outcomes of the negotiation: either the two parties reach some consensus (to sell the plant at an agreed-upon price) or they are unable to reach an agreement, and BioPharm must build a new plant instead (a costly option).
