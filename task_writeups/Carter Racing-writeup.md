## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get several pages of description about a dilemma facing a racecar team, which involves deciding whether to go ahead with the race that would begin in the immediate future. The description mentions that the team has been experiencing a series of engine failures and that an engine failure during this race on national television will present a danger to the driver and team's sponsorship. However, if the team does well on the race, it will get a lucrative sponsorship deal.

Participants are given a chart with information about the temperatures during the last 7 engine failures, which shows a range of temperatures 53-75 degrees and a mean temperature of 64 degrees. The chart is misleading because it does not contain information about the air temperature when the car does NOT experience an engine failure (therefore, the information is biased).

Participants are also given instructions that mention that they can ask for any additional information during the task, but that the request must be precise.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to come up with reasons and ultimately decide to terminate the participation in the race within a fixed amount of time.

The data in the description is gathered from the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident in 1986. The relationship between ambient temperature and O-ring failure is disguised as the relationship between air temperature and car engine failures. In other words, participants that decide to go ahead with the race make a decision that is parallel to the decision to go ahead with the Space Shuttle Challenger launch.

Participants have to recognize that the data they have is inconclusive and ask the experimenter for the air temperatures when the engine have not failed. If they do so, the experimenter provides them with an additional chart of the last 17 races without an engine failure. The chart shows that races are clearly warmer when engine failures does not occur with the range of 66-82 degrees and a mean temperature of 73 degrees.

Therefore, the only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race, while participants that come up with a conclusion to proceed with the race fail the task. Participants also have to explain their reasoning behind this decision by finding a relationship between engine failures and air temperatures.
