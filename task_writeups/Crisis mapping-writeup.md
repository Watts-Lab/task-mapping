# Crisis mapping

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a "crisis mapping" tool on a computer. They view a collection of pre-processed 1567 tweets about Typhoon Pablo in the Philippines, which were posted on December 4-5, 2012, and they receive detailed instructions on how to navigate the crisis mapping interface.

Some of the tweets contain information relevant to the typhoon, such as evacuation centers, damaged infrastructure, or number of deaths, while other tweets are irrelevant to the disaster.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to select relevant tweets and geo-locate, time-stamp, and categorize damage/flooding photos and videos in them, creating a precise and accurate crisis map for Typhoon Pablo within a fixed amount of time.

Experimenters pre-define a "gold standard" map with 49 distinct events in different regions. Participants only get credit based on how close their map is to the "gold" map. Therefore, their goal is to identify as many relevant events as possible without including irrelevant events, and the highest possible score is achieved when they identify precisely the same events as those in the "gold standard."

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.
