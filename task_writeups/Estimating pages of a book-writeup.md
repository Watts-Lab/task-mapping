# Estimating pages of a book

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see images of the page edges of a book.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to guess the exact number of pages that the book has, using only the image of the page edges. 

Participants are rewarded for being as precise and as close to the true number of pages as possible. They get points proportional to how many pages "off" they were, corrected for the total number of pages in the book. For example, 10 pages wrong out of a 400-page book is a smaller error than 10 pages wrong out of a 50-page book. Participants are not told if their judgment is exactly correct. Finally, participants have a limited amount of time to make their judgment.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills
