# Categorization problem

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive 16 cards with pictures of two objects on each one (32 total objects). Half of the objects (16) on the cards are related to each other, and can be grouped into four categories. For example, the categories could be "vehicles," "animals," "furniture," and "shapes." There are four objects per category. The remaining 16 objects are distractors. There is one category object and one distractor on each card.

Participants see all the objects depicted on the cards in a random order. They do not know which objects on the cards belong to the four categories and which are distractors, which makes this task difficult. For example, "furniture" may be one of the categories, and participants' cards may include a picture of an armchair, bar stool, office chair and table. However, there may also be distractors, such as an alarm clock and wall clock, which could "throw off" someone attempting to figure out the categories --- they may think that the alarm clock, wall clock, and office chair are all related to a category of going to work, and therefore miss the true category of "furniture."

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to identify the 16 cards belonging to categories, and correctly form four categories with them, within a fixed amount of time. 

The task is designed in such a way that it is impossible to form four categories if participants start using distractor objects; there is only one objective way of forming categories so that all cards are used. Participants either complete this task by forming the four objectively correct categories, or they fail.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Problem solving, categorization, teamwork.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Ask for instructions and clarifications; in first training session: see each others' cards, ask questions and get feedback on correct categories; in second training session: see other participants, exchange cards freely, describe cards to other participants; experimental tasks: use all 16 cards; fill out post-task questionnaire.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
