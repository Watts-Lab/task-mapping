# Desert survival

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants view information describing a survival scenario in which a plane crashes in the desert. The survivors are able to salvage a list of 16 items (e.g., water, machete, compass, cosmetic mirror) from the wreckage. Everyone sees the same list of items.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to rank all 16 items in the order of most important to least important for survival. For example, if water is the most important for survival, then it would receive the rank of 1. If the cosmetic mirror is the least important for survival, then it gets the rank of 16.

Participants' rankings are evaluated based on how close their rankings are to those created by a panel of survival experts. That is, the expert ranking is the "true" answer, and the closer a participant is to the true answer, the more points they earn. The highest possible score is achieved when participants rank all 16 items in the exact same order as the experts did.

If working in a team, participants are able to discuss the scenario with each other and come up with a single set of rankings as a team.
