task,question_name,value
9 Dot Problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"Instructions say up to 4 lines, but it would take the full 4 lines to achieve the goal."
9 Dot Problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
9 Dot Problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Its mostly logical, but the main, one, answer sounds like it needs creativity to figure out."
9 Dot Problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"This one was difficult to answer, I could see both sides, dividing and not diving."
9 Dot Problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Pretty confident on this one, even though they are fighting against the clock."
Abstract grid task,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It's the opposite with performing the task in fewest clicks but it is the same general idea.
Abstract grid task,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"There is a series of clicks, leading to an optimal lowest number, but the actual goal is just to produce the image and complete it."
Abstract grid task,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"There could be a creative way to solve this, as opposed to just brute force."
Abstract grid task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Theres too many interconnecting steps, as each step affects the rest."
Abstract grid task,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There is an image that must be recreated, so I consider that a precise outcome."
Abstract grid task,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There is one best, but that isnt what is being judged. Basically, completion is being judged, even if it takes a 1000 steps."
Advertisement writing,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,The actual writing and/or drawing of the ad is physical
Advertisement writing,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,I would think part of the task would be to take different perspectives on what should be submitted and build a cohesiove ad.
Advertisement writing,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"there is a time limit but, doesn't seem very relevant"
Advertisement writing,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"hard to say, it could not applicable"

Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,there is no right or wrong solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,there is no right or wrong answer
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,there is no right or wrong solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It is an allocation task but I still think some creativity is required in how to allocate.
Allocating resources to programs,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I took the precision as the $500,000 that must be allocated."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I chose no as I think there would still be subjectivity as to whether the solution was correct.
Allocating resources to programs,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,The allocation will be determined by consensus.
Allocating resources to programs,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,I feel this is a planning task because you have been allocated a sum of money and you must plan on how to distribute the funds among various programs.
Allocating resources to programs,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"Since the 500K can be distributed in different amounts, I would say that there are several (3) ways to distribute the funds."
Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes because you have 500K and you must distribute the funds among 3 social/government programs and you get to decide how to allocate the funds. So, as long as the whole 500K are distributed, you have found a solution."
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"The goal here is to distribute 500K not whether the way the funds were distributed is correct. So, an outside party would simply have to evaluate if the whole 500K were distributed among the 3 programs."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Again, in this scenario, the solution is to distribute 500K among 3 programs. That is what is evaluated. What is not evaluated is how the funds were distributed or why one program received more funds over another program."
Allocating resources to programs,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"If a participant completed the objective of distributing the whole 500K, then I could objectively say that the goal was accomplished."
Allocating resources to programs,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I hope I have understood the instructions correctly. 1.) The set-up describes 3 programs that require funding. 2.) The participant's job is to allocate 500K dollars among the 3 programs as he/she sees fit. So, as long as the 500k were distributed, the goal has been achieved."
Allocating resources to programs,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"There are tradeoffs because some programs will not receive the same amount of money even if you wanted them to and as such, you have to decide which of the 3 programs would be more beneficial."
Allocating resources to programs,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,The group must work together to determine how to spend the money across different programs
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,it doesn't say you can't work in groups but it doesn't say you can
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,there is a fixed amount of time
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,the distractor cards that are conflicting.
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,they could have accidently used a distractor card and not know until the end if they passed or failed.
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"only after you finish the problem will you know what the ""trick"" is/ distractor cards."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,They will have to take in the information on the cards and brainstorm to determine the correct categories. 
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,To determine the groups you will need some form of creativity 
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It's unclear if there's a competition between several users, but you are at the least competing to get the 4 groups correct. "
Categorization problem,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You only win if you get the 4 groups correct
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Users could try to divide the task so some users take 1-2 groups a piece. 
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,You have to get all 4 groups correct or you fail
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,I assume you can try different methods to determine the groups
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There are distractors to try and throw off the players of the game
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Until they get to the end they will feel unsure if they guess the groups correctly
Categorization problem,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Yes, planning is involved yet writing is minimal and memory is essential."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"Yes, but in the end I can see that this task is simply categorization and requires no generating of new ideas."
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Yes, a little.  Creativity is helpful here yet not the full extent of the task."
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"No, there is one way to successfully complete this task.  All other results will fail."
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No, all sub-parts are interdependent, so the task is best completed by one individual."
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Yes, there is a limited amount of time to complete this task.  It's my experience that the allotted time is usually sufficient yet for some this can still be troublesome.  Because there is a time limit, speed is considered an important goal."
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"No, there is one acceptable outcome.  This is written in the instructions."
Categorization problem,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No, the instructions help answer this question by stating that there is a specific set of four categories and the 16 card do belong to their associated categories."
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"No, this is clearly a task that will include some trial and error.  There will be several ways to achieve the same/correct result."
Categorization problem,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"No, it can be shown that a solution is either correct or incorrect."
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Yes.  I had a problem with this question mostly because I can't imagine how an algorithm can solve the task.  But I do think one could be made to do it.  I could not determine, from the instructions, if the particiant can look at all cards at the same time or if they could see only one card at a time.  I think I see that only one card is shown at a time, but it is not very clearly stated.  This would make a difference."
Categorization problem,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes, I did.  The instructions indicate this is a difficult task.  Yet it does not say this task is impossible.  Therefore, besides being lucky, there must be enough information available for participants to come up with the correct answer."
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No, the distractors are examples of conflicting information in this task.  If I tried to complete this task, I would call them teasers."
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No, there will be uncertainty by the participants, especially at the early stages of the task."
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, because I have not attempted this task.  However, I know of no trick and would be uncertain until I was about half way through."
Checkers,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"Technically, checkers is a solved game, so in my opinion there is always a ""best solution"" for it."
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Playing this game and winning it's not an operation that can be calculated or selected, and there are many, many ways to reach the final goal of removing all the opponent's rounds"
Checkers,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,I had no issue answering this question.
Checkers,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,I'm not really sure if you have all of the computer's pieces just on a technicality because you can block them in and win the game when they have a piece left.
Checkers,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"Mostly mental, but not clear if checker board is virtual or physical so unclear as to how much physical movement needed"
Checkers,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If working as a group different participants will need to work together to determine correct course of action
Checkers,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,competition against computer opponent
Checkers,Q10maximizing_elaboration,There is a time limit so participants would need to work as quickly as possible
Checkers,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I believe a checker master or computer would know if a move is correct or not.
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,An algorithm could be programmed to provide the best move based on the other pieces on the board
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There are many different moves that can be made
Checkers,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I believe moves are mostly logical but subjective in that there are multiple moves to choose

Computer maze,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Computer maze,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Participants may not know if they've correctly identified matches until the end.
Computer maze,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,no because in this task you have to pairs the most amount of greebles as soon as possible
Computer maze,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"no, needed no more clarification"
Computer maze,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"no, no following steps involves no planning is needed"
Computer maze,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"no, it doesn't need brainstorming ,you just have to pair some greebles"
Computer maze,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,no because it is a grouping greebles task
Computer maze,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"no, it only needs to pair all of the identical greebles together"
Computer maze,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"no,"
Computer maze,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"no, you have to pair as much greebles as possible in certain amount of time "
Computer maze,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"no, you have to achieve the goal of pairing all of the identical greebles correctly"
Computer maze,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"no, because the best solution is the one that tags all the greeble pairs  correctly "
Computer maze,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"no , you can verify if all of the pairs were tagged correctly"
Computer maze,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"no, because there are specific set rules to follow and certain outcomes"
Computer maze,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,When you fiqure ot the differences in the greebies you will do better
Computer maze,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It's hard to know exactly what is involved with navigating the maze or why this would required thought or creative thinking.
Computer maze,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"The navigation portion IS all or nothing, but the tagging is not, so overall, the task is NOT all or nothing, but a component is."
Computer maze,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"The player has to complete the maze, but only receives reduced score for less than maximum.  It would be clearer if I knew how the greebles scoring worked."
Computer maze,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Incorrectly tagging greebles can be seen as a tradeoff to failing to tag at all.
Desert survival,Q10maximizing_elaboration,most points
Desert survival,Q11optimizing_elaboration,the goal is to be exact or as clost as possible to the experts
Desert survival,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there is a perfect answer but it is not necessary
Divergent Association Task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Divergent Association Task,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I believe a word expert could determine semantic distance
Divergent Association Task,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,If there were semantic rules already established then there could be a solution based on that data
Divergent Association Task,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think different people could argue semantic distance based on their own perceptions
Divergent Association Task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"Again, unless there are predetermined semantic distance scores I think you could make arguments for or against"
Divergent Association Task,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Without knowing semantic distance scores they won't know until they are scored
Divergent Association Task,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,This is assuming there are defined scores attached to words.
Divergent Association Task,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"There is no mention of looking up answers online but if allowed, it would be an advantage here."
Divergent Association Task,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,The solution has a subjective element attached to it.
Estimating geological metrics,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Yes, since only restraint is not looking up solutions online. Other resources could be used. "
Estimating geological metrics,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,The participant who comes closest to the actual numbers receives the maximum score and wins.
Estimating geological metrics,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"The scenario clearly states that participants have a fixed amount of time. Therefore, they need to work as quickly as possible."
Estimating geological metrics,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"If the distance between point A and point B is X miles, then it cannot be Y miles or Z miles. The correct answer is X miles."
Estimating geological metrics,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,Participants can use many methods to try to come up with an answer. 
Estimating geological metrics,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Participants are asked to estimate a distance without looking up the answer. So, based on this, any answer would simply be an estimate or guess because there is not enough information for a precise solution."
Estimating geological metrics,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"If I guess that the distance between point A and B is 3.5 miles and the actual distance is 3.5 miles, how can I demonstrate I am right without looking up the solution which we are barred from doing? "
Estimating geological metrics,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The answer here is objective and there is no trickery involved.
Estimating geological metrics,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work

Estimating pages of a book,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,To guess exactly right would be the only correct way 
Estimating pages of a book,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Since it's about being given a total number of pages and guessing about what the thickness equals to, there could be an algorithm that could be written to solve it"
Estimating pages of a book,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"To get the exact number I don't think there's enough info, you're making an educated guess"
Estimating pages of a book,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"I don't think an outsider would know the answer for sure, only the person that created the problem"
Estimating pages of a book,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you're making an educated guess it's a little subjective
Estimating pages of a book,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Since they're not being told if they were correct or not I would say they're unsure
Estimating pages of a book,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"I think that checking the number of pages in the book would be ""outside"" the system but I'm not sure."
Estimating pages of a book,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"The way I understand it, the limiting factor is the time - work as quickly as [possible top get as closely as possible, so I said yes."
Estimating pages of a book,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"I think there are a lot of ways this could be done - having everyomne guess and taking the average, using a magnifying glass on the picture, etc."
Estimating pages of a book,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"The objective is precise, but I wouldnt think there is an absolute, verifiable, solution. You could guess and get the right answer. A reasonable, educated guess, like guessing beans in a jar."
Estimating social quantity,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"In this case, participants are asked to estimate the median age in the U.S in 2009 but are not given any other information and are not allowed to look up the solution. So, it would be a guess"
Estimating social quantity,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Here, participants will only know how close to the actual answer they came when an independent person judges the answers."
Estimating social quantity,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,There is no trick involved in this solution.
Estimating social quantity,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Estimating social quantity,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,They need to use the knowledge they know and may or may not know this information since they cant look it up
Estimating social quantity,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Does not say when they see results
Estimating social quantity,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I think it really depends on what the algorithm has been learning. If it's learned about this specific topic, then I would yes, it could probably solve this. But if it's just an algorithm that hasn't been learning anything about this phenomena, then probably not. However, it may still be able to give estimates comparable to that of human participants, especially if they're just guessing."

Hidden figures in a picture (Recall Task),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"There is no aha moment. The participants find the objects as they see them on the image. I would like to call out an error on this particular assignment. In the ""Set-Up"" it states participants are given a list of images to discover in a picture and then ""click on it."" In the Objective-Goal, it states that participants must recall as many animals as they can from the original list. Participants type and submit the words using the webpage NOT ""click on it."" So there are conflicting instructions here."

Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think different people can have different justifications for their answers
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Could be a brainstorming task if you're using the process of elimination to arrive at the correct answer.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It's unclear if there's a competition between several users, but you are at the least competing to get the highest possible score. "
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You either get the answer correct or not.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task

Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"The task as described didn't specify that the players would be working together or not. But since it also didn't say that a participant (or group of participants) with the highest score would be a winner if they maximized their score, I think I answered ""No"" correctly. But it was a bit confusing as most trivia quizes are part of competitive games irl."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"It wasn't specified in the task if the participants would be working together on a team or each doing their own quiz. And it wasn't speficied if the questions would be presented one after another (as real life trivia games often do) or if you could pick and choose from the whole list at once. So I was very unconfident. I went with they would all be working gether from a page of questions, and so could split them up to be more efficient."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"It really depends on how many questions are available. If there are only 10 questions then it would be a no (I think), but if it is a very long list, then it would be a yes"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"According to the description there is a maximum score possible, so I wasn't sure if that was "" a precise outcome"""
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"Technically getting all of the answers correct would be a best solution I think, but without knowing if it is reasonable to get them all done (for example if there were 100 question in a 5 minute timer, that would not even be possible) it is hard to say there is a best solution"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Assuming a bot isn't preprogrammed with all of the knowledge in the world, I think this is no"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I assume you wouldn't be allowed to look up the correct answer as part of the knowing it when you see it
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I wasn't sure if the ""infinite resources"" part meant that a person could look up authoritative answers and show them to someone as proof that the solution was right. That would break the rules of the task, but maybe could be done as part of the scoring/explanation process after the task?  It wasn't clear if this question referred to the task itself or was just asking in general."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"depends on whether the questions get graded 1 by 1 or only at the end.  answered assuming the latter, if the former than no"
Visual Oddball Target,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,There is a physiological aspect to visual perception - someone with poor vision due to a physical ailment may struggle more with this visual perception task - so it was a little harder to define for me.
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I struggled somewhat with this one because there is only one correct answer to each grouping, however it isn't possible to get close to the correct answer without actually being correct, so it doesn't seem like precision is the right concept to describe it"
Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It is not clear whether participants get feedback on their responses immediately or not
Visual Oddball Target,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Because there's some visualization required there may be a fraction of creativity needed. 
Visual Oddball Target,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,Since you either identify the oddball or not I think it's an all or nothing task

Whac-A-Mole,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"The game doesn't have solutions, so I don't think this question applies."
Whac-A-Mole,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I don't think this question applies given the task.
Whac-A-Mole,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,they have to share the screen so they need to compete to click circles before another does.
Whac-A-Mole,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"there is not solution, there is just points to gain"
Whac-A-Mole,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,if you program the algorithm to play then yes it can do it.
Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"there is no solution, it's just gaining points"
Whac-A-Mole,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,if there is no time limit then you can gain indefinate points

Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Not a actual solution
Whac-A-Mole,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,No correct answer
Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,If the participant somehow guesses randomly all best oil fields they could achieve the best solution.  Unlikely but technically possible.
Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Sounds like more of a hunting and guessing task.
Wildcat Wells,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Again, nearly impossible but if participant guesses all best oil fields randomly the could get the ""best answer"""
Wildcat Wells,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"i assume this is a game map, not a map of an actual area where they drill for wells but this may need to be specified if people are being anal about the details"
Wildcat Wells,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,it's tough to definitively answer this with such a brief description
Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work

Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Not a actual solution
Wildcat Wells,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,No provable solution
Wildcat Wells,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They know how many points they get
Wildcat Wells,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"There is no info in the description about most points. It sounds like the winner is the winner and everyone else looses. Nothing about points or anything, just find the most oil"
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,It really depends on what the mao shows you as to how you go about completing the task
Wildcat Wells,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"The only way to ""win"" is to find the most. There might be different algorithms to it, but the goal is most"

Word completion given starting letter,Q11optimizing_elaboration,Does creating the maximum number of valid words in a specific time a precise outcome?
Word completion given starting letter,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,some may be unsure if they wrote an invalid word but thought it was valid when doing it.
Word completion given starting letter,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I wasn't entirely clear if I should account for whether it is reasonable or not. There are only so many words in the English language, and so I finite numbr of words that start and end with 2 given letter. So there is a theoretical maximum number of words and with enough time time a group could get them all. But it is very unlikely, especially not in a reasonable time limit. So..."
Word completion given starting letter,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"is this question asking if one specific solution (word here) can be judged as correct, or whether the group of words as a whole can be judged as correct? As in, is the group all possible words matching the ruleset?"
Word completion given starting letter,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Again, are you asking about one answer within the group of answers, the group as a whole being all of the possible words that match the rules. Because, yes, you can know one word fits, but you can't know if all of the words have been found..."
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,Because the letter pop up once the timer starts it would be difficult to plan for the task

Word construction from a subset of letters,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,it is not really creative to generate a list of words that someone is already familiar with-but involves the same mental effort
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q11optimizing_elaboration,all words generated must be 4 letters and english
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,a person could simply generate random four letter combinations.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,the intellectual ability of the participant can actually be enough to know every possible four letter word in the english language.( not me though)
