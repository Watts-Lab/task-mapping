Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I wasn't sure if the ""infinite resources"" part meant that a person could look up authoritative answers and show them to someone as proof that the solution was right. That would break the rules of the task, but maybe could be done as part of the scoring/explanation process after the task?  It wasn't clear if this question referred to the task itself or was just asking in general."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I chose no as I think there would still be subjectivity as to whether the solution was correct.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I assume no, as there is the element of chance"
Search for Oil Task,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I think because this is mostly a memory task it can't just be explained as a ""best"" solution"

Railroad Route Construction game,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,No trouble.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I think there is an element of a participant's risk tolerance in coming up with the best solution.
Estimating pages of a book,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you're making an educated guess it's a little subjective
Railroad Route Construction game (Impossible Version),Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I would say it is more N/A since it is an impossible task.
Divergent Association Task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"Again, unless there are predetermined semantic distance scores I think you could make arguments for or against"
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you have to confirm whether or not they're actual words I would think it's objective. 
Putting food into categories,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,no because it is a judgmental task and can not be demostrable with number or statistic
Allocating resources to programs,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I hope I have understood the instructions correctly. 1.) The set-up describes 3 programs that require funding. 2.) The participant's job is to allocate 500K dollars among the 3 programs as he/she sees fit. So, as long as the 500k were distributed, the goal has been achieved."

"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"the elaboration here is unclear. there are literally ""tradeoffs"" here."
Computer maze,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Incorrectly tagging greebles can be seen as a tradeoff to failing to tag at all.
Putting food into categories,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,no because in this cases the ideas can or can not be able to divide the items there would be no trade offs in the brainstorming
Allocating resources to programs,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"There are tradeoffs because some programs will not receive the same amount of money even if you wanted them to and as such, you have to decide which of the 3 programs would be more beneficial."

However, an agreement can be made that there is a trick by using grouping or association or making a story out of the words which is considered a memory trick. If I was to teach someone how to memorize fast using a memorization strategy, it may be considered an ""aha"" moment as well.  "
Putting food into categories,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"no because the solution is obvious once it proposed, in this case you will know how to divide the items as soon as you propose the way to do it"
