9 Dot Problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Pretty confident on this one, even though they are fighting against the clock."
Abstract grid task,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It's the opposite with performing the task in fewest clicks but it is the same general idea.
Abstract grid task,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Participants are not given feedback so it will depend on individual ability.
Abstract grid task,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"There is a series of clicks, leading to an optimal lowest number, but the actual goal is just to produce the image and complete it."
Abstract grid task,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"There could be a creative way to solve this, as opposed to just brute force."
Abstract grid task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Theres too many interconnecting steps, as each step affects the rest."
Abstract grid task,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There is an image that must be recreated, so I consider that a precise outcome."

Abstract grid task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Advertisement writing,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,The actual writing and/or drawing of the ad is physical
Advertisement writing,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,I would think part of the task would be to take different perspectives on what should be submitted and build a cohesiove ad.
Advertisement writing,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Doesn't say there is a way to win or earn points
Advertisement writing,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"there is a time limit but, doesn't seem very relevant"

Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,there is no right or wrong solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It is an allocation task but I still think some creativity is required in how to allocate.
Allocating resources to programs,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I took the precision as the $500,000 that must be allocated."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I chose no as I think there would still be subjectivity as to whether the solution was correct.

Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,No correct answer
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,No provable solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,I feel this is a planning task because you have been allocated a sum of money and you must plan on how to distribute the funds among various programs.
Allocating resources to programs,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"Since the 500K can be distributed in different amounts, I would say that there are several (3) ways to distribute the funds."
Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes because you have 500K and you must distribute the funds among 3 social/government programs and you get to decide how to allocate the funds. So, as long as the whole 500K are distributed, you have found a solution."
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"The goal here is to distribute 500K not whether the way the funds were distributed is correct. So, an outside party would simply have to evaluate if the whole 500K were distributed among the 3 programs."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Again, in this scenario, the solution is to distribute 500K among 3 programs. That is what is evaluated. What is not evaluated is how the funds were distributed or why one program received more funds over another program."
Allocating resources to programs,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"If a participant completed the objective of distributing the whole 500K, then I could objectively say that the goal was accomplished."
Allocating resources to programs,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I hope I have understood the instructions correctly. 1.) The set-up describes 3 programs that require funding. 2.) The participant's job is to allocate 500K dollars among the 3 programs as he/she sees fit. So, as long as the 500k were distributed, the goal has been achieved."
Allocating resources to programs,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"There are tradeoffs because some programs will not receive the same amount of money even if you wanted them to and as such, you have to decide which of the 3 programs would be more beneficial."
Allocating resources to programs,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"when they say ""resolve different conflicts in people's values and interests"" do they mean there is a team resolving it, or do they mean the hypothetical people in the hypothetical government?"
Allocating resources to programs,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,The group must work together to determine how to spend the money across different programs
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,it doesn't say you can't work in groups but it doesn't say you can
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,there is a fixed amount of time
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,the distractor cards that are conflicting.
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,they could have accidently used a distractor card and not know until the end if they passed or failed.
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"only after you finish the problem will you know what the ""trick"" is/ distractor cards."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,They will have to take in the information on the cards and brainstorm to determine the correct categories. 
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,To determine the groups you will need some form of creativity 
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It's unclear if there's a competition between several users, but you are at the least competing to get the 4 groups correct. "
Categorization problem,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You only win if you get the 4 groups correct
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Users could try to divide the task so some users take 1-2 groups a piece. 
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,You have to get all 4 groups correct or you fail
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,I assume you can try different methods to determine the groups
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There are distractors to try and throw off the players of the game
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Until they get to the end they will feel unsure if they guess the groups correctly
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Depends on how well the algorithm identifies categories.
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"It seems to me like there'd be some creativity in coming up with categories that objects could belong to, but there's only one objectively correct solution to the problem, so I would say that little creativity is actually involved in this task."
Categorization problem,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Yes, planning is involved yet writing is minimal and memory is essential."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"Yes, but in the end I can see that this task is simply categorization and requires no generating of new ideas."
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Yes, a little.  Creativity is helpful here yet not the full extent of the task."
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"No, there is one way to successfully complete this task.  All other results will fail."
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No, all sub-parts are interdependent, so the task is best completed by one individual."
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Yes, there is a limited amount of time to complete this task.  It's my experience that the allotted time is usually sufficient yet for some this can still be troublesome.  Because there is a time limit, speed is considered an important goal."
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"No, there is one acceptable outcome.  This is written in the instructions."
Categorization problem,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No, the instructions help answer this question by stating that there is a specific set of four categories and the 16 card do belong to their associated categories."
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"No, this is clearly a task that will include some trial and error.  There will be several ways to achieve the same/correct result."
Categorization problem,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"No, it can be shown that a solution is either correct or incorrect."
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Yes.  I had a problem with this question mostly because I can't imagine how an algorithm can solve the task.  But I do think one could be made to do it.  I could not determine, from the instructions, if the particiant can look at all cards at the same time or if they could see only one card at a time.  I think I see that only one card is shown at a time, but it is not very clearly stated.  This would make a difference."
Categorization problem,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes, I did.  The instructions indicate this is a difficult task.  Yet it does not say this task is impossible.  Therefore, besides being lucky, there must be enough information available for participants to come up with the correct answer."
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No, the distractors are examples of conflicting information in this task.  If I tried to complete this task, I would call them teasers."
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No, there will be uncertainty by the participants, especially at the early stages of the task."
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, because I have not attempted this task.  However, I know of no trick and would be uncertain until I was about half way through."
Checkers,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"You can win checkers in a limited, but wide variety of ways.  In some ways it applies here, but there is not one precise outcome other than ""win"" so it doesn't apply."
Checkers,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,some planning involved
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I think most computers could beat a human
Checkers,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,n/a it's a game between 2 people
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"not sure if this applies here, but you either win or lose"
Checkers,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"Technically, checkers is a solved game, so in my opinion there is always a ""best solution"" for it."
Checkers,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"In checkers, one must always plan the initial move and subsequent moves based on the opponent's moves."
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Since an algorithm cannot anticipate the opponent's moves, it would not be effective in this scenario."
Checkers,Q11optimizing_elaboration,To capture all 12 of the opponent's pieces.
Checkers,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Multiple moves to choose from each turn.
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Playing this game and winning it's not an operation that can be calculated or selected, and there are many, many ways to reach the final goal of removing all the opponent's rounds"
Checkers,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,I had no issue answering this question.
Checkers,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,I'm not really sure if you have all of the computer's pieces just on a technicality because you can block them in and win the game when they have a piece left.
Checkers,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"Mostly mental, but not clear if checker board is virtual or physical so unclear as to how much physical movement needed"
Checkers,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If working as a group different participants will need to work together to determine correct course of action
Checkers,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,competition against computer opponent
Checkers,Q10maximizing_elaboration,There is a time limit so participants would need to work as quickly as possible
Checkers,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I believe a checker master or computer would know if a move is correct or not.
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,An algorithm could be programmed to provide the best move based on the other pieces on the board
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There are many different moves that can be made
Checkers,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I believe moves are mostly logical but subjective in that there are multiple moves to choose

Computer maze,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"no,"
Computer maze,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"no, you have to pair as much greebles as possible in certain amount of time "
Computer maze,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"no, you have to achieve the goal of pairing all of the identical greebles correctly"

Computer maze,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"no , you can verify if all of the pairs were tagged correctly"
Computer maze,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"no, because there are specific set rules to follow and certain outcomes"
Computer maze,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,When you fiqure ot the differences in the greebies you will do better
Computer maze,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It's hard to know exactly what is involved with navigating the maze or why this would required thought or creative thinking.
Computer maze,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"The navigation portion IS all or nothing, but the tagging is not, so overall, the task is NOT all or nothing, but a component is."
Computer maze,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"The player has to complete the maze, but only receives reduced score for less than maximum.  It would be clearer if I knew how the greebles scoring worked."
Computer maze,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Incorrectly tagging greebles can be seen as a tradeoff to failing to tag at all.
Computer maze,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,All participants are working on individual screens
Computer maze,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"There could be a lot of creativity involved, as far as identifying the distracting greebies"

Computer maze,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There is one “correct answer” but partial credit, "
Crisis mapping,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Since there is a fixed amount of time, participants may want to divide the tweets."
Crisis mapping,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,If this was a group task it would make sense to divide the work between the group
Crisis mapping,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"It would depend if the person you're explaining it to had access to the right, pre-defined map/correct answers."
Crisis mapping,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It says a fixed amount of time in the instructions.
Crisis mapping,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"depends entirely on when the feedback on whether they chose correctly is provided, which isn't mentioned in the description.  "
Desert survival,Q10maximizing_elaboration,most points
Desert survival,Q11optimizing_elaboration,the goal is to be exact or as clost as possible to the experts
Desert survival,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there is a perfect answer but it is not necessary

Desert survival,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"This one is hard, there are many ways to generate the lost and you get points for any list, basically, but there is a best list"
Desert survival,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,It’s a judgement task that’s only evaluated at the end
Desert survival,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If working as a group different participants will need to work together to determine final list
Desert survival,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think different people can have different justifications for their answers
Desert survival,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,The group does not know the final list so must come up with a consensus.

Divergent Association Task,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,There is no trick involved in this solution.
Divergent Association Task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Divergent Association Task,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I believe a word expert could determine semantic distance
Divergent Association Task,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,If there were semantic rules already established then there could be a solution based on that data
Divergent Association Task,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think different people could argue semantic distance based on their own perceptions
Divergent Association Task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"Again, unless there are predetermined semantic distance scores I think you could make arguments for or against"
Divergent Association Task,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Without knowing semantic distance scores they won't know until they are scored
Divergent Association Task,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,This is assuming there are defined scores attached to words.
Divergent Association Task,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"There is no mention of looking up answers online but if allowed, it would be an advantage here."
Divergent Association Task,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,The solution has a subjective element attached to it.
Estimating geological metrics,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Depends on how well the algorithm answers trivia.
Estimating geological metrics,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Yes, since only restraint is not looking up solutions online. Other resources could be used. "
Estimating geological metrics,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,The participant who comes closest to the actual numbers receives the maximum score and wins.
Estimating geological metrics,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"The scenario clearly states that participants have a fixed amount of time. Therefore, they need to work as quickly as possible."
Estimating geological metrics,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"If the distance between point A and point B is X miles, then it cannot be Y miles or Z miles. The correct answer is X miles."
Estimating geological metrics,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,Participants can use many methods to try to come up with an answer. 
Estimating geological metrics,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Participants are asked to estimate a distance without looking up the answer. So, based on this, any answer would simply be an estimate or guess because there is not enough information for a precise solution."
Estimating geological metrics,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"If I guess that the distance between point A and B is 3.5 miles and the actual distance is 3.5 miles, how can I demonstrate I am right without looking up the solution which we are barred from doing? "

Estimating pages of a book,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,Guessing exactly right would be difficult but it's the best solution
Estimating pages of a book,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,To guess exactly right would be the only correct way 
Estimating pages of a book,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Since it's about being given a total number of pages and guessing about what the thickness equals to, there could be an algorithm that could be written to solve it"
Estimating pages of a book,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"To get the exact number I don't think there's enough info, you're making an educated guess"
Estimating pages of a book,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"I don't think an outsider would know the answer for sure, only the person that created the problem"
Estimating pages of a book,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you're making an educated guess it's a little subjective
Estimating pages of a book,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Since they're not being told if they were correct or not I would say they're unsure
Estimating pages of a book,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The answer here is objective and there is no trickery involved.
Estimating pages of a book,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"I think that checking the number of pages in the book would be ""outside"" the system but I'm not sure."
Estimating pages of a book,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"The way I understand it, the limiting factor is the time - work as quickly as [possible top get as closely as possible, so I said yes."
Estimating pages of a book,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"I think there are a lot of ways this could be done - having everyomne guess and taking the average, using a magnifying glass on the picture, etc."
Estimating pages of a book,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"The objective is precise, but I wouldnt think there is an absolute, verifiable, solution. You could guess and get the right answer. A reasonable, educated guess, like guessing beans in a jar."
Estimating social quantity,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"In this case, participants are asked to estimate the median age in the U.S in 2009 but are not given any other information and are not allowed to look up the solution. So, it would be a guess"
Estimating social quantity,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Here, participants will only know how close to the actual answer they came when an independent person judges the answers."
Estimating social quantity,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,There is no trick involved in this solution.
Estimating social quantity,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"not confident since one is supposed to give an estimate without looking up  the solution, i think it qualifies for having enough information to answer the question"
Estimating social quantity,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,proof here would be the resource of available statistical data 
Estimating social quantity,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Estimating social quantity,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,They need to use the knowledge they know and may or may not know this information since they cant look it up
Estimating social quantity,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Does not say when they see results
Estimating social quantity,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I think it really depends on what the algorithm has been learning. If it's learned about this specific topic, then I would yes, it could probably solve this. But if it's just an algorithm that hasn't been learning anything about this phenomena, then probably not. However, it may still be able to give estimates comparable to that of human participants, especially if they're just guessing."

Space Fortress,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,No.  Points are earned during the task and total scores are evaluated.  This means that any points earned may be used to determine payout.
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No.  Multiple players have an overall advantage, so the help is appreciated."
Space Fortress,Q10maximizing_elaboration,No.  There is no mention of a time limit here.  The goal is to destroy the fortress.  The game will end when that happens or if your own ship is destroyed.
Space Fortress,Q11optimizing_elaboration,No.  There is an outcome to be achieved but it is not a precision task.
Space Fortress,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No.  Although the best solution is to destroy the fortress, there could be many ways to achieve this."
Space Fortress,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,No.
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,No.  The solution will be evident to all once achieved.
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,No.  This is a video game that responds to programmed stimuli.  An algorithm is often designed to achieve success in these situations.
Space Fortress,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"No.  There is a finite number of obstructions to tend to, so it seems nothing more is needed."
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"No.  If one is successful with this task, it could be explained how each obstacle was overcome."
Space Fortress,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"No, although a""objectively correct solution"" may not be the normal wording for this type of task."
Space Fortress,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,No.  This is an objective task.
Space Fortress,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No.  Points are important, but the real goal is to destroy the fortress.  That is the object.  Any lesser achievement is objectively not as good and can be easily graded.  So, room for compromises are extremely limited."
Space Fortress,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No.  Any new participants to this task will not be absolutely sure their strategy will be successful.  However, experienced participants will at least know what did not work well in past attempts."
Space Fortress,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, this is tricky so let me explain.  There are many obstacles, some of them move and we do not know the speed of the task items.  Unknowns are a real problem.  A plan of action could arise after experimentation where outer mines are dealt with first.  Or, the plan may be to ignore the mines and concentrate on the fortress while taking evasive action.  In either case, skill and dexterity become essential.  Therefore, I'd say the many approaches to this task are more important to realize than trying to discover an ""aha"" moment where one strategy will win all or most of the time."
Space Fortress,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"The set-up and object do not describe how participants navigate, either through keyboard, joystick or perhaps mental telepathy."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,I don't have a sense of the degree of planning or strategy involved to avoid mines and take down the fortress.
Space Fortress,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It's unclear how much of the success depends on strategy or luck or finger twitches.
Space Fortress,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,I'm not sure if there is a trick to this game basedon the information providedl
Space Fortress,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There are different ways to achieve the outcome, but the goal is to destroy the fortress, which is a precise outcome, right?"
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"Doing this in this case would be tedious, but it could be done, couldn't it?"
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I don't really know what robots or algorithms can do, but since this isn't a creative task, this seems like something they can be programmed to accomplish.  "
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,Hmmm.  I'm not 100% sure on this one.
Space Fortress,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"There are multiple ways to accomplish the goal, but each one can be proven to be successful (although it would be laborious)."
Space Fortress,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."
Space Fortress,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."

Space Fortress,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."
Space Fortress,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I don't think this question applies given the task, so I left the answer in the middle."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,Some physically in using the controls for the game.
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Participants can divide which sides of the ship to attack from.
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Destroying the fortress would be the ""correct"" answer."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This task requires good eye-hand coordination.
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,There is a single player and multi-player version so it depends on which one
Sudoku,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Still unsure if time limit alone is enough to make this a yes answer or not.
Sudoku,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,They are working e=with chat box and may recieve different information from others but I dont think there is a trade off
Summarize Discussion,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"It's a fine line and I'm not sure about this answer.  There are conflicting solutions and pieces of information that come from the participants, not necessarily from the task."
Summarize Discussion,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"Since there is no objective answer, the issue of uncertainty is really around whether they have written a quality argument."
Summarize Discussion,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This scenario requires active discussion so there is physical effort involved.
Summarize Discussion,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,All submitted written arguments favoring or opposing the question will be subjective.
Summarize Discussion,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"There is no absolute answer to the subject they are opposing or advocating for, there is just a written response with arguments in favor or against."
Summarize Discussion,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,I think it is somewhat creative as people need to create arguments
Summarize Discussion,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,There is not a right or wrong answer because it is fully subjective
Summarize Discussion,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"There is not a solvable problem, fully subjective"
Summarize Discussion,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,I think participants will have conflicting ideas of how to complete the task
Summarize Discussion,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Participants have a specific time limit for completing the writeup
Summarize Discussion,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,They are graded on the quality of their final written summary.
Summarize Discussion,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,They are graded on the quality of their final written summary.
Summarize Discussion,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I think they all have to work together
Summarize Discussion,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Timed 
Summarize Discussion,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,graded on quality
Summarize Discussion,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,this is a subjective task
Target Search,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,There is some creativity in the first guess then how to proceed based on feedback
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I couldn’t even think how you would break this into independent subparts
Target Search,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"There is a “max” or best, but VERY unlikely"
Target Search,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There is a whole range of possible point totals
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"This was hard to answer, cause it’s just getting points as opposed to a “solution”"
Target Search,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"no, you have to reconsider the coordinates depending on the feedback you get"
Target Search,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"no, because they have to analyze very coordinate"
Target Search,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,you have to plan what coordinates to choose and plan other coordinates depending on the values they get
Target Search,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"maybe, ideas have to be considered to think where the center of the target"
Target Search,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"no, because being creative does not show you the logical cells that you have chosen to get near a target"
Target Search,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"no, its not a win or lose situation its more of an analysis situation"
Target Search,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"no, because here you have to search for as many high values cells as possible"
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"no, because the sub parts would have to depend from the feedback given from the answer they gave before"
Target Search,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"no, because you would have to give the right coordinates to achieve the goal"
Target Search,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Initially you may not plan your first strike, but afterwards you would plan out where you think the next best point of attack would be."
Target Search,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Your team would want to map out your next strike
Target Search,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"
Target Search,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"You're looking to get the maximum amount of point, it's not pass/fail"
Target Search,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Target Search,Q11optimizing_elaboration,There is a precise answer you're wanting to get but it's almost impossible to achieve.  But it is graded on a gradient scale
Target Search,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,Guessing exactly right would be difficult but it's the best solution
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,You will know right after you pick your target how close you are and how many points you got
Target Search,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Target Search,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,You receive feedback to let you know if you were right.
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I think if you have data to support you could prove that it is best to choose a certain method to find the target
Target Search,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,Since participants are told their point value I think they could prove their choices correct or not
Target Search,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,I think the AHA moment is when you click or choose a cell worth points and have identified part of the target
Target Search,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"No, since trial and error is likely involved."
Target Search,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No, since the goal is to get the most points."
The Fish game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It wasn’t quite clear whether they would be competing against each other, or just against a “max points”"
The Fish game,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"This is also iffy. There is a max score but it’s not clear if there is one or many ways. The description says there is trial and error, so that made this question harder to answer."
The Fish game,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This task requires mental effort and motor skills to move cursor.
The Fish game,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,Participants have to decide whether to explore other areas in the room or plan on where to go next.
The Fish game,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"Touching the wall means you lose all your points but if they don't touch it they still accumulate points so it is not an ""all or nothing"" scenario"
The Fish game,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Participants try to get as many points as possible before the time limit expires.
The Fish game,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This game is by trial and error. You try to find the room offering the highest rewards.
The Fish game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Participants can explore other locations in the same room and possibly not get any points or they can explore other areas for higher points or possibly zero points.
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,no teams
The Fish game,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"It's not clear how much clicking is involved or what it takes to move from one location to another. This isn't a straight clicking task, but requires thinking about where to go more than actual movement."
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Each participant controls their own cursor
The Fish game,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,since trial and error or luck is involved I think it is not applicable
The Fish game,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This relies on the participant properly exploring.
The Fish game,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,This depends on knowing the highest possible points.
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,There is nothing to divide since each participant is playing separately
The N light bulbs game,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,It seems like only trial and error works for this task.

The N light bulbs game,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If they are working as a team
The N light bulbs game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I struggled with this one. I couldn’t see how something like this could be subdivided but I suppose it’s possible.
The N light bulbs game,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,There could be 1 or more solutions that give the highest possible points
The N light bulbs game,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"While there is a way to finish the task without getting the maximum points, the max is the goal and therefore only one correct answer"
The N light bulbs game,Q11optimizing_elaboration,there is a best configuration but participants won't be told if they achieved it
The N light bulbs game,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there is a best configuration but participants won't be told if they achieved it
The N light bulbs game,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Only if you are told the best configuration was achieved, otherwise you will not know."
The N light bulbs game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"You could select a bulb that performs ""best"" but then your next guess could be worse performing, so this could go on forever until you quit."
The N light bulbs game,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"they might not find out even after the game, if they got the ""best"" solution."
The N light bulbs game,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"This is a puzzle game and it is only a YES if you are told at the end that you got the ""best"" solution."
The N light bulbs game,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,The team will try to figure out which non-stuck light to switch
The N light bulbs game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"

The N light bulbs game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Multiple users can work at once, but only one decision is made"
The N light bulbs game,Q10maximizing_elaboration,There are a limited number of guesses but it doesn't state that it's timed
The N light bulbs game,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"While there is a theoretical “best” configuration, participants will not be told if they have achieved it"

The N light bulbs game,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"They are informed how many points they earned, but they won't know if that's the maximum or not"
The N light bulbs game,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"the lightbulbs can be thought of as binary variables (a 0 or 1), which would then allow this game to be played by an algorithm"
The N light bulbs game,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,They aren't informed if they achieved the most possible points for the light
The N light bulbs game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,The players won't know if the points shown could be improved or are the maximum allowable. 
The N light bulbs game,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"While there is a theoretical “best” configuration, participants will not be told if they have achieved it"
The N light bulbs game,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"If working in teams, everyone collectively determines the next guess."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,This is purely a decision of whether to evacuate or not given the information provided.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"This task has an all-or-nothing element. If you choose not to evacuate and disaster strikes, you lose everything."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,They make their selection for evacuation individually.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q11optimizing_elaboration,The goal here is to choose or not to choose to evacuate. It is either or so the participants are asked to choose between two precise outcomes.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,The best solution here is to choose not to evacuate and avert disaster to earn a high reward.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,This is a binary choice...yes or no.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I took the goal as precise, to avoid the disaster."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I went back and forth on this one, I could see it going either way but if someone wants to avoid risk, the best solution might be evacuating even if a disaster does not strike."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I think an algorithm could be set up here to choose whether to evacuate or stay based on the risk level.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I think there is an element of a participant's risk tolerance in coming up with the best solution.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,They are either right or wrong about whether to evacuate
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"For example, one person could come up with pros, another cons"
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,It’s basically a guess 
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,There is a well defined set of outcomes
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"I assume my answer is correct as it would not require 'more' of anything, except luck maybe."

Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think different people can have different justifications for their answers
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Could be a brainstorming task if you're using the process of elimination to arrive at the correct answer.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It's unclear if there's a competition between several users, but you are at the least competing to get the highest possible score. "
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You either get the answer correct or not.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There is a precise answer you're wanting to get, but it is graded on a gradient scale"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"It's a ""right or wrong"" task"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"Either you know the answer and select it, or you can use the process of elimination to arrive at the correct answer"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"The task as described didn't specify that the players would be working together or not. But since it also didn't say that a participant (or group of participants) with the highest score would be a winner if they maximized their score, I think I answered ""No"" correctly. But it was a bit confusing as most trivia quizes are part of competitive games irl."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"It wasn't specified in the task if the participants would be working together on a team or each doing their own quiz. And it wasn't speficied if the questions would be presented one after another (as real life trivia games often do) or if you could pick and choose from the whole list at once. So I was very unconfident. I went with they would all be working gether from a page of questions, and so could split them up to be more efficient."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"It really depends on how many questions are available. If there are only 10 questions then it would be a no (I think), but if it is a very long list, then it would be a yes"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"According to the description there is a maximum score possible, so I wasn't sure if that was "" a precise outcome"""
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"Technically getting all of the answers correct would be a best solution I think, but without knowing if it is reasonable to get them all done (for example if there were 100 question in a 5 minute timer, that would not even be possible) it is hard to say there is a best solution"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Assuming a bot isn't preprogrammed with all of the knowledge in the world, I think this is no"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I assume you wouldn't be allowed to look up the correct answer as part of the knowing it when you see it
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I wasn't sure if the ""infinite resources"" part meant that a person could look up authoritative answers and show them to someone as proof that the solution was right. That would break the rules of the task, but maybe could be done as part of the scoring/explanation process after the task?  It wasn't clear if this question referred to the task itself or was just asking in general."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,One of the multiple choice answers is correct.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"depends on whether the questions get graded 1 by 1 or only at the end.  answered assuming the latter, if the former than no"
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,All participants are working on individual screens
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,This is a trivia quiz so entirely depends on the individual.
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,It would depend on how the multiple choice questions are administered. Are they given in random order? Is the question order static? 
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"No. There is a wee bit of physical typing of each unscrambled word.  So, I brought the slider down to one tick above entirely mental effort."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Yes, I pondered this for a while.  The task requires one answer and there is only one answer.  So, the answer needs to come from what words you already know.  This task comes from your knowledge of the English language, which is not really planning."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"No, creativity comes into play here with regularity.  But that creativity is somewhat mixed with real knowledge as well."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"Yes, but I thought it through and answered No.  This is because the task components - each scrambled word - are by themselves a win/lose situation, but points are awarded per unscrambled word.  So, you needn't unscramble all words to gain a reward.  Highest overall score will gain higher rewards, but all players who unscramble at least one word will also gain points."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No, the divide and conquer method would be very beneficial in this task.  Colloboration with a partner would also work well here."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q10maximizing_elaboration,"No, the amount of work needing completion is clearly stated in the i nstructions.  This is a times task, so speed is a factor."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q11optimizing_elaboration,"No.  There is only one outcome for each word, so precision is key to success."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No.  In this task, there is only one solution for each word.  So, the best solution is the only acceptable solution."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,No.  The various ways to success would be most evident when working with a partner.  
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,No.  A dictionary offered by a third party can determine the validity of each answer.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,No.  An algorithm can stored all words of the English language.  It can the look at the scrambled word and determine the correct answer from its database.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,No.  Yet this does depend on the participant's knowledge of the English language.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,No.  
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,No.  This is clearly stated in the instructions.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No.  Conflicts can only appear if the participant enters an incorrect solution (one that is not a real word).  In this case, overall knowledge of the language is the culprit, not conflicting answers."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No.  Some participants will not arrive at the correct solution immediately yet insert a likely answer out of desperation or ""best guess"".  They may hope it is right, but will need to wait for verification."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,No.  This is a type of task where every component (each of the 24 words) will be unique and looking for a pattern is quite difficult.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q11optimizing_elaboration,The goal is to unscramble as many words from the list as possible.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,The best solution is to unscramble all 24 anagrams.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There are many ways to unscramble a sequence of letters. Some might start at the beginning of the letters and work forward while others may start at the end.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,There is no trick involved in this solution.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I am not sure based on the instructions if participants have to go one word at time.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q11optimizing_elaboration,"The closer to solving all 24 words, the better."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,proper spelling is critical to complete the task
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,the instructions do not state that a spellchecker can not be used and can check all 24 words
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"There could be differences in “correctness” of words or how to go about unscrambling, but it doesn’t seem like a primary thing"
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q11optimizing_elaboration,There is precision because there is only one  or text word per anahran
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Just the constraint of the time element
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,It’s either right or not

Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It is not clear whether they are given immediate feedback
Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,This depends on the participant's ability to correctly identify objects.
Visual Oddball Target,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"All participants are working individually, otherwise ""yes"""
Visual Oddball Target,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,There is a physiological aspect to visual perception - someone with poor vision due to a physical ailment may struggle more with this visual perception task - so it was a little harder to define for me.
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I struggled somewhat with this one because there is only one correct answer to each grouping, however it isn't possible to get close to the correct answer without actually being correct, so it doesn't seem like precision is the right concept to describe it"
Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It is not clear whether participants get feedback on their responses immediately or not
Visual Oddball Target,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Because there's some visualization required there may be a fraction of creativity needed. 
Visual Oddball Target,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,Since you either identify the oddball or not I think it's an all or nothing task
Visual Oddball Target,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"You have to identify the oddball or you lose, the outcome is precise"
Visual Oddball Target,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Because it's a visual task I would assume it's purely a human task
Visual Oddball Target,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think once you identify it you know whether it's correct or not
Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the pattern correct or not
Visual Oddball Target,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Visual Oddball Target,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Set Up and Objective did not disclose any group information

Wason's Selection Task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Wason's Selection Task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"If a team, the most intelligent should do all of the work, or at least help the others understand it."
Whac-A-Mole,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"The wording is vague as stated in ""thereby maximizing their points"". It doesn't say their own points or if it is referring to their team."
Whac-A-Mole,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No discrete parts.
Whac-A-Mole,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I am not sure how this would be done based on the instructions so lean towards no.
Whac-A-Mole,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"With unlimited time, yes, a participant could show what would result in the maximum."
Whac-A-Mole,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There are different targets to choose from.
Whac-A-Mole,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"Mostly mental, but some physical as participants need to use the mouse to click targets."
Whac-A-Mole,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,It is unclear if this is a group or individual task
Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This is not a task that you find a solution to.
Whac-A-Mole,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,This is not a task you find a solution to
Whac-A-Mole,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"The game doesn't have ""solutions"" so the question seems to not apply."
Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"This type of game doesn't have ""solutions"" so the question doesn't seem to apply."
Whac-A-Mole,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"The game doesn't involve solving problems and it doesn't have ""right answers"" so I don't believe the question applies."
Whac-A-Mole,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,The game doesn't have problems/solutions so I don't think this question applies.
Whac-A-Mole,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"The game doesn't have solutions, so I don't think this question applies."
Whac-A-Mole,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I don't think this question applies given the task.
Whac-A-Mole,Q11optimizing_elaboration,“As many points as possible” seems to fit this
Whac-A-Mole,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"“Hit all the moles that come up” seems like it’s the only way, but I am not confident about this answer"
Whac-A-Mole,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"It’s not exactly formal, per se, but just hit the right colored moles seems like the possible algorithm "
Whac-A-Mole,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Time and the different point values versus how fast you can move the mouse
Whac-A-Mole,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,they have to share the screen so they need to compete to click circles before another does.
Whac-A-Mole,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"there is not solution, there is just points to gain"
Whac-A-Mole,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,if you program the algorithm to play then yes it can do it.
Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"there is no solution, it's just gaining points"
Whac-A-Mole,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,if there is no time limit then you can gain indefinate points
Whac-A-Mole,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,they won't know how many points gained unless it is displayed.
Whac-A-Mole,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,there is no solution to find

Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,If the participant somehow guesses randomly all best oil fields they could achieve the best solution.  Unlikely but technically possible.
Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Sounds like more of a hunting and guessing task.
Wildcat Wells,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Again, nearly impossible but if participant guesses all best oil fields randomly the could get the ""best answer"""
Wildcat Wells,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"i assume this is a game map, not a map of an actual area where they drill for wells but this may need to be specified if people are being anal about the details"
Wildcat Wells,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,it's tough to definitively answer this with such a brief description
Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Wildcat Wells,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,Only looking for points not a concrete solution
Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Not a actual solution
Wildcat Wells,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,No provable solution
Wildcat Wells,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They know how many points they get
Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Instructions do not say if there is a limit to the number of clicks.
Wildcat Wells,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Multiple wells to choose from.
Wildcat Wells,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They might have a general idea but there would still be uncertainty.
Wildcat Wells,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"There is no info in the description about most points. It sounds like the winner is the winner and everyone else looses. Nothing about points or anything, just find the most oil"
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,It really depends on what the mao shows you as to how you go about completing the task
Wildcat Wells,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"The only way to ""win"" is to find the most. There might be different algorithms to it, but the goal is most"
Wildcat Wells,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I THINK you could do that, but the set up is a little ambiguous, so its hard to be very confident in my answer"
Wildcat Wells,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"I would assume yes, that there is an algorithm, but it is hard to tell from the description."
Wildcat Wells,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"This sounds like an individual task, not group."
Wildcat Wells,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"From the description it sounds like guess work, so, although it is sytematic, there is no way for n algorythim to find the best solution."
Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Ther is nothing that leads the participant to knwo what is the best method, sounds like a guessing game.."
Wildcat Wells,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Again, it is guessing."
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,unknown
Wildcat Wells,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,unknown-maybe the highest # of points can be gotten in different ways
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Although it does involve planning I'm not sure there would be so many variations on the answer that it would qualify as a brainstorming task. 
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"There is only a few ways to accomplish the task, and it either works or you fail"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q10maximizing_elaboration,Because you're trying to accomplish the task in as few trips as possible
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there are a few different scenarios that will accomplish the task but not many
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There aren't a huge amount of way to do it but there's more than one
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Once you understand the rules I don't think they conflict
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"It is ""planning"", but there's not any writing, really"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"the elaboration here is unclear. there are literally ""tradeoffs"" here."
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"the ""aha"" or ""trick"" is explained in the objective/goal"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there are 2 solutions
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"2 ways to solve, so, not ""many"" and not one"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Word completion given part of word,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,I think users would be naturally brainstorming on all possible words that could be formed with the available letters.

Word completion given part of word,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Word completion given part of word,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,For some words I think there could be multiple solutions so participants may not know until the end if their answer was correct
Word completion given part of word,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,It was a little confusing with the info provided.
Word completion given starting letter,Q11optimizing_elaboration,Does creating the maximum number of valid words in a specific time a precise outcome?
Word completion given starting letter,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,some may be unsure if they wrote an invalid word but thought it was valid when doing it.
Word completion given starting letter,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I wasn't entirely clear if I should account for whether it is reasonable or not. There are only so many words in the English language, and so I finite numbr of words that start and end with 2 given letter. So there is a theoretical maximum number of words and with enough time time a group could get them all. But it is very unlikely, especially not in a reasonable time limit. So..."
Word completion given starting letter,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"is this question asking if one specific solution (word here) can be judged as correct, or whether the group of words as a whole can be judged as correct? As in, is the group all possible words matching the ruleset?"
Word completion given starting letter,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Again, are you asking about one answer within the group of answers, the group as a whole being all of the possible words that match the rules. Because, yes, you can know one word fits, but you can't know if all of the words have been found..."

Word construction from a subset of letters,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Either the answers submitted are valid four-letter words or they are not.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The answer here is objective and there is no trickery involved.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,Because the letter pop up once the timer starts it would be difficult to plan for the task

Word construction from a subset of letters,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,If the words can be verified to be actual words it's correct
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this 
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you have to confirm whether or not they're actual words I would think it's objective. 
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They may think they've created a word but may not know it's incorrect until after it's over
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,it is not really creative to generate a list of words that someone is already familiar with-but involves the same mental effort
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q11optimizing_elaboration,all words generated must be 4 letters and english
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,a person could simply generate random four letter combinations.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,the intellectual ability of the participant can actually be enough to know every possible four letter word in the english language.( not me though)
