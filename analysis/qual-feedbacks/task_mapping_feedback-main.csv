9 Dot Problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"Instructions say up to 4 lines, but it would take the full 4 lines to achieve the goal."
9 Dot Problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
9 Dot Problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
9 Dot Problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"well, there are no ""exact steps"""
9 Dot Problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Its mostly logical, but the main, one, answer sounds like it needs creativity to figure out."
9 Dot Problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"This one was difficult to answer, I could see both sides, dividing and not diving."
9 Dot Problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Pretty confident on this one, even though they are fighting against the clock."
Abstract grid task,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It's the opposite with performing the task in fewest clicks but it is the same general idea.
Abstract grid task,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Participants are not given feedback so it will depend on individual ability.
Abstract grid task,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"There is a series of clicks, leading to an optimal lowest number, but the actual goal is just to produce the image and complete it."
Abstract grid task,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"There could be a creative way to solve this, as opposed to just brute force."
Abstract grid task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Theres too many interconnecting steps, as each step affects the rest."
Abstract grid task,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There is an image that must be recreated, so I consider that a precise outcome."
Abstract grid task,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There is one best, but that isnt what is being judged. Basically, completion is being judged, even if it takes a 1000 steps."
Abstract grid task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Advertisement writing,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,The actual writing and/or drawing of the ad is physical
Advertisement writing,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,I would think part of the task would be to take different perspectives on what should be submitted and build a cohesiove ad.
Advertisement writing,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Doesn't say there is a way to win or earn points

Advertisement writing,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,I thought it would take more time coming up with an answer than writing it.
Advertisement writing,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Since it involves multiple people chipping in, i think it is a planning task."
Advertisement writing,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,It's a judgment call and many offerings could be suitable.
Advertisement writing,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"I think it's possible that people might have to resolve differences in opinion if they were working in teams but based on the information provided, it can't be described as a ""main purpose."""
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"The answer is a little squishy cause we are negotiating so there is an element of following steps and writing them down, so I wasn’t aure"
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"There is logical n getting a good term sheet, but creativity in getting the other party to “like” you"
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,I think negotiation qualifies
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"There is competition in negotiation, but there is also the other component"
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q11optimizing_elaboration,You are scored but the metric is shaky and not completely known
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,There is a high score but not a well defined method to get there since part of it is subjecyive
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,You can compare scores and verify the highest one
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"You could be the nicest person in the world but if the other team score you bad, then you loose. It’s subjective"
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q18ans_recog_elaboration,I think it’s too subjective to know this
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q19time_solvability_elaboration,Someone could follow your instructions exactly but still fail due to subjectivity
Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"Each is negotiating while still trying to maximize social capital, huge tradeoff"

Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,there is no right or wrong solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,there is no right or wrong answer
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,there is no right or wrong solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It is an allocation task but I still think some creativity is required in how to allocate.
Allocating resources to programs,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I took the precision as the $500,000 that must be allocated."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I chose no as I think there would still be subjectivity as to whether the solution was correct.
Allocating resources to programs,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,The allocation will be determined by consensus.
Allocating resources to programs,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Timed
Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Not an actual solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,No correct answer
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,No provable solution
Allocating resources to programs,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,I feel this is a planning task because you have been allocated a sum of money and you must plan on how to distribute the funds among various programs.
Allocating resources to programs,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"Since the 500K can be distributed in different amounts, I would say that there are several (3) ways to distribute the funds."
Allocating resources to programs,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes because you have 500K and you must distribute the funds among 3 social/government programs and you get to decide how to allocate the funds. So, as long as the whole 500K are distributed, you have found a solution."
Allocating resources to programs,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"The goal here is to distribute 500K not whether the way the funds were distributed is correct. So, an outside party would simply have to evaluate if the whole 500K were distributed among the 3 programs."
Allocating resources to programs,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Again, in this scenario, the solution is to distribute 500K among 3 programs. That is what is evaluated. What is not evaluated is how the funds were distributed or why one program received more funds over another program."
Allocating resources to programs,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"If a participant completed the objective of distributing the whole 500K, then I could objectively say that the goal was accomplished."
Allocating resources to programs,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I hope I have understood the instructions correctly. 1.) The set-up describes 3 programs that require funding. 2.) The participant's job is to allocate 500K dollars among the 3 programs as he/she sees fit. So, as long as the 500k were distributed, the goal has been achieved."
Allocating resources to programs,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"There are tradeoffs because some programs will not receive the same amount of money even if you wanted them to and as such, you have to decide which of the 3 programs would be more beneficial."
Allocating resources to programs,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"when they say ""resolve different conflicts in people's values and interests"" do they mean there is a team resolving it, or do they mean the hypothetical people in the hypothetical government?"
Allocating resources to programs,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,The group must work together to determine how to spend the money across different programs
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,It was not detailed in the description if there was more than one way to approach attacking the targets.
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,Not applicable as a target is simply destroyed or it is not.
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"There is no correct answer, only scoring as much as possible."
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q19time_solvability_elaboration,There is no solution
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,some creativity might be involve with controlling the helicopter
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,technically the concept of this game involve divide and conquer since you are reliant on each person to do a certain task (e.g. gunner)
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,its a video game so you can't know. You learn as u go.
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,Mostly mental but is the sim like a physical simulator or just a game?
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"It is a good combo of both, creative and logic"
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,They need to work together but each person has a defined role

Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"If you get 30 points, by definition it’s correct"
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Unknown how much depends on instruction versus the people
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I honestly am not sure on this one
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Without more info I would say yes there are different things to consider
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,By design there are separate roles for participants.
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,This will heavily depend on how much creativity is needed to achieve the goals. The description is vague on that end.
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,doesn't specify that the team is in competition with another team
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,specifies that they will get role-specific training
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"surviving, earning score, completing objective"
Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,best possible score
Architectural design task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Some of the choices in this scenario will be subjective like what colors to use but one must also use logic to adhere to the rules of the task.
Architectural design task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Architectural design task,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,The wording on scoring is vague. It does mention to follow design rules or fail.
Architectural design task,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,This depends on how well an algorithm can design architecture. Some creativity might be required.
Architectural design task,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"I believe that different participants may come up with different solutions to the same problem, but only the highest value achieved would be the best answer"
Architectural design task,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"no, because it takes planning to design"
Architectural design task,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"no, because you have to think and plan in order to complete your goal"
Architectural design task,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"no, because sub groups can work on different buildings that do not depend from one another and they can this way finish faster"
Architectural design task,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"no, because you have to build specifically a house, a garage and a pool"
Architectural design task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"its more objective because you have to build a house, garage and pool with certain amount of blocks following rules and its also subjective because you can be creative when designing what you do"
Architectural design task,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,You are planning out the build of a house
Architectural design task,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,It could involve some brainstorming if working in groups
Architectural design task,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,There are some rules that must be adhered to but otherwise creativity is encouraged.
Architectural design task,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"
Architectural design task,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,It's based on the highest score not pass/fail
Architectural design task,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Architectural design task,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"There could be if you adhere to all rules, hit all bonuses, and have no point deductions."
Architectural design task,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"I believe they learn as they go, points for certain objects for building the house are revealed"
Architectural design task,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Architectural design task,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Since it's a creative build task I don't think there's a ""right"" answer"
Architectural design task,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"Since it's a creative build task I don't think there's a ""right"" answer"
Architectural design task,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since it's a creative task I think it's more subjective
Arithmetic problem 1,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,There is exactly one right answer hence it the aim is not generation of ideas or brainstorming.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"The problem is logical but a bit of creative thinking cannot hurt. Since people work in groups, they may create ideas before applying logic to arrive at the correct solution."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,Task graded based on how close a submission is to the true minimum time. Hence not a win/lose situation.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"It says people can work in groups and discuss their answers, so it can be a divide and conquer task."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There is only one right answer which is optimal. However several ways do exist and that is the reason why the task is graded on how close a submission is to the ideal. Hence highest score for correct answers, but others are given reduced points based on its closeness to the optimal."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"Yes, I wish the divisions on the line above were smaller (the line would be divided into smaller sections) so I could indicate that this is even more mental than physical.  The only physical portion of this task is to write or type the notes required."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"No, the math will show the solution to this task."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"No, there are solutions that will reduce the current production time, but only one solution will minimize the time the most."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"No.  This task is a win/lose situation relative to other participants, although since there is one best answer then there may be multiple winners."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,No.  Points are awarded according to the degree of success participants advance to the goal.  This means points are good and a reward is forthcoming for most.  Some players will likely gain more points than others.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No.  Five decisions need to be made and each decision will affect the other decisions.  The decisions are too linked to each other, none are independent."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"No.  The task is timed, but no one sub-task is repetetive in nature."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q11optimizing_elaboration,No.  The precise outcome is to report how the maximum production can be attained.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,No.  This is outlined in the instructions.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,No.  There may be more than one way to achieve the same desired outcome.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,No.  This is mostly a math problem.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"No.  Since this is a math problem, an algorithm can be developed to determine the best solution."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes, I had trouble with this question.  The instructions included each man's time for only 3 of the 5 machines.  The data for the remaining 2 machines (4 and 5) were not included.  This missing information makes the task much more difficult.  If I am wrong here and the data given in the instructions are meant to be simply a partial example of what the particpants can expect to see, then I would change my answer to ""Yes, there is enough information""."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,No.  Number can easily explain the best solution.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"No.  The best answer will not be an opinion, it will be demostrated objectively."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"Yes, this question requires clarification.  If the participants are given the desired result of 10 minutes, then they have something to shoot for and they will know if they achieved this before sumbitting their answer.  If, however, the participants are not given the 10 minute goal, then this is where to task time limit comes in.  Participants must arrive at any pairing of man and machine to reduce production time, then they have the rest of their time to try to improve on that."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, this is tricky.  I would need to perform this task to be sure if there is or is not an ""aha"" moment.  If I'm right, I would be able to do this within the given time, but an ""aha"" moment probably not appear."
Arithmetic problem 1,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"since there's a time limit, maybe it is ....?"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"""Those working in groups can discuss their answers before submitting in an online portal"""
Arithmetic problem 1,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"It depends here on whether the hints provided in the Objective / Goal are divulged to the participant. Specifically: ""In the optimal answer, the total time to create the product is 10 minutes."""
Arithmetic problem 1,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"again, same as above"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"Again, this depends on whether the participant knows what the optimal answer is : ""In the optimal answer, the total time to create the product is 10 minutes."""
Arithmetic problem 1,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,This scenario requires creativity and logic.
Arithmetic problem 1,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"Since score is based on the timer closest to the true minimum time, this tells me that it is only until the end that the participants will know the outcome. Therefore, they will feel unsure. "
Arithmetic problem 1,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,You have to plan out the best order of machine placement for each person
Arithmetic problem 1,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Trying to figure out the best configuration would take some out of the box thinking
Arithmetic problem 1,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,It's based on the highest score not pass/fail
Arithmetic problem 1,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Arithmetic problem 1,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"In the optimal answer, the total time to create the product is 10 minutes"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"In the optimal answer, the total time to create the product is 10 minutes"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Arithmetic problem 1,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"I don't think an outsider would know the best possible answer for sure, only the person that created the problem"
Arithmetic problem 1,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Arithmetic problem 1,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"I'm answering this in this way because I make the assumption that disclosure of the 10 minute time, with correct machine assignment is for the researcher and not made available to participants."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,There is not enough information for one person to figure out the solution.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Primarily a logic task.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,It's collaborative but I don't think it's necessarily a difference of opinion or viewpoint.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"While members have different information, I don't think it conflicts."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,I don’t see the creativity here
Arithmetic problem 2,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"Well there needs to be colabaration, so differing perspectives"
Arithmetic problem 2,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,Competing against the clock but not with each other
Arithmetic problem 2,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,It’s best if they work together
Arithmetic problem 2,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,Collaborate and get all the information processed is the only way
Arithmetic problem 2,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,If the model had all information
Arithmetic problem 2,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,I don’t think this question applies
Arithmetic problem 2,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Not conflicting but they do need to work together
Arithmetic problem 2,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,If not given an answer within the time limit then it's nothing outcome
Arithmetic problem 2,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Clue is randomly distributed among members so I'm not sure if that's 'conflicting' pieces of information but there is tradeoffs.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"Well, in this case, there is a ticking clock element....so they do need to beat the clock which made me question more if that is considered a win/lose based on the clock."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,No mention is made about the precision or accuracy (plane arrival) - just that they need to share clues to solve the problem.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"Very difficult. It doesn't mention about precision of the answer they come up with, but it is implied that they must work together and share clues in order to solve the problem - and the problem has a precise answer."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"The wording of ""in order to reach solutions"" possibly implies that there is more than one best solution - but the goal of determining the plane's arrival time doesn't have much wiggle room as to accuracy of the solution.."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I think that if each clue is presented, it could be solved with an algorithm, but since the set-up involves multiple participants each having a piece of the puzzle, that sounds like a social dynamic at play that relies on group cooperation. So I said no."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I am assuming this means after everyone has shared their clues, then yes, you can both solve and show the solution."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Sometimes arithmetic problems need to be solved in a certain order, however they're trying to achieve one concrete answer and not reordering events, so I believe it's NOT a ""planning"" task."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"The clues are given, but participants need to mold them into something helpful which involves some creative problem-solving but not as much as generating a new idea."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"Presumably the clues are factual, so while there may be disagreement on how to organize them or what they imply, there aren't different ""viewpoints"" to use a persuasive argument for."
Arithmetic problem 2,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,You can solve the problem or not (pass/fail) but are not competing.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You can either solve the problem or not.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Clues must be combined to make sense.
Arithmetic problem 2,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Only required to finish within time limit, not a race and accuracy is pass/fail."
Battle of the sexes,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,This is not a collaborative effort where 2 players are trying to reach the same goal.
Battle of the sexes,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"I think this is and isn't answerable based on what each player shares about their choices, and the truthfulness of their choices."
Battle of the sexes,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,it is not a problem you can solve
Battle of the sexes,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,there is no trick
Battle of the sexes,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Some creativity involved in trying to manipulate the other player
Battle of the sexes,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"The goal is to maximize the total for both players, so your “competing” against the game"
Battle of the sexes,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,Since it relies on judgements I would say there are different way
Battle of the sexes,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Its subjective
Battle of the sexes,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,There are many ways it could go so a path to the solution would be varying
Battle of the sexes,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Whether you get the max or not
Battle of the sexes,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,This isn’t stated in the description
Battle of the sexes,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,Participant can choose to cooperate or compete with others.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q1concept_behav_elaboration,No trouble at all and I had no need for additional clarification.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q10maximizing_elaboration,"I mean, there is a time limit, but how much time there is within that limit, I'm not sure. If I knew their time limit, I could say a definite yes or no."
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,It is not specified what happens if you pick a suboptimal candidate.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,Discussions are involved so there may be various ways.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There exists a right candidate though it can only be determined after some discussions due o the design of the game.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"There are positive, negative and neutral characters to consider among the candidates."
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Only after the group discussions can the participants be fairly certain.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,There is no one aha moment as the several factors are systematically analyzed.
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"constraints may influence the methods that the group can use to reach their decision, but within those constraints, the group is free to use their own judgment and decision-making process."
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"They have to share info, discussing who would be best"
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"The big realization is that the group needs to share info, which is a creative idea, but the figuring out which is best is logic based"
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,The winning condition is to decide which one is the best
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,This is the opposite of the right answer
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q11optimizing_elaboration,The precision comes in figuring out which is “right”
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"How they come to the decision is left up to the group, so there could be many trains of thought that lead there, but success is deciding the one correct answer"
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Assuming the algorithm had perfect information, which the group as a whole has but individual member do not, then yes"
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,If they work together
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I think so since each facet is given numerical values
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"The objective answer is the right person for the job, the person with the max score"
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Each person has different info
Best job candidate (hidden-profile),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The aha moment is realizing you have to combine all info as a froup
Biopharm Seltek,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,This is a negotiation
Biopharm Seltek,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,Not clear about what amount of keyboarding/dialog needs to be done with negotiation partner.
Biopharm Seltek,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,The creativity would be related to how to achieve the best outcome for the buyer or seller.
Biopharm Seltek,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"The price is the factor to be decided upon.  Each side doesn't know something about the other.  These could possibly be used to persuade, or otherwise influence the decision of the other toward a certain outcome"
Biopharm Seltek,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"I see it as more of a cooperation goal, or negotiation task than a battle because both are trying to achieve a desirable outcome."
Biopharm Seltek,Q10maximizing_elaboration,There does not appear to be a timing or speed element
Biopharm Seltek,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"The goal is to reach a deal, but the price is not a specific goal, rather a negotiation."
Biopharm Seltek,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I don't know how the price choices are presented.  If there are exact choices for each side, then this would be a yes, perhaps.  If the amount is open-ended, then the answer is no."
Biopharm Seltek,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There's not a description of the interaction, so I have to assume there's open chat and open price negotiation.   This would provide innumerable solutions.  A more structured interface could be a yes for this."
Biopharm Seltek,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"I had to check ""not answerable"" because it's not clear if there is a demonstrably correct answer that and expert could evaluate.  If there are correct valuations for Seltek, then an outsider could verify the correctness, but the task instructions do not say there is a certain best outcome price."
Biopharm Seltek,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Both sides have sufficient motivation and the means to consummate a better outcome or solution.
Biopharm Seltek,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Unless the price choices are fixed, then the amount of the negotiated price is subjective."
Biopharm Seltek,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"It's difficult with so many options for the negotiation, but each side can say the solution is right based on the objectives of paying less and selling for more (or at all)  Each side has a right outcome"
Biopharm Seltek,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Reaching agreement is the correct, objective answer."
Biopharm Seltek,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,There is always at least some creativity in negotiating
Biopharm Seltek,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,There is two objectives
Biopharm Seltek,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"There is both. There is a yes no answer and if the answer is yes, then a price."
Biopharm Seltek,Q11optimizing_elaboration,I would say
Biopharm Seltek,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"As long as the actually decide to sell, there is a wide range of outcomes"
Biopharm Seltek,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I’m not sure what they mean by this
Biopharm Seltek,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"It relies on emotions so there is a huge range of “valid” olutions, as long as a deal is rwached"
Blocks World for Teams,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"The previous question was pretty clear from the clues in the set-up, but only if you're familiar with the terms ""virtual"" and ""avatar"" and what those terms imply.  Also, it depends on the interface being used to control a participant's avatar."
Blocks World for Teams,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"This question depends on the interface that is being used; if the interface is say, a computer mouse, then it's very low effort physically, but if a VR setup is used, then it's a bit more physical."
Blocks World for Teams,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Although the set-up instructions are a bit vague, I think this task is probably a planning task because there's a proper way to accomplish the task that would involve coordination.  It would be nice to know details about whether or not participants have any time before starting the actual activity whether they have time to plan the task before diving in."
Blocks World for Teams,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,It's in a virtual world
Blocks World for Teams,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Because there's no communication between the team members I would assume this wouldn't be considered a brainstorming task
Blocks World for Teams,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to complete the task in a certain amount of time I assume it's against another person or team"
Blocks World for Teams,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You either get the sequence correct or not.
Blocks World for Teams,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Multiple users can work at once separately to get their portion of the sequence correct
Blocks World for Teams,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Blocks World for Teams,Q11optimizing_elaboration,There is only one correct answer
Blocks World for Teams,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"It's a ""right or wrong"" task"
Blocks World for Teams,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There is only one correct sequence so I would assume there's one best way to complete the task
Blocks World for Teams,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Blocks World for Teams,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"It's unclear if they have enough information to solve, but I would assume they're not completely ""flying blind"" during the task"
Blocks World for Teams,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,You receive feedback to let you know if you were right.
Blocks World for Teams,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"It's unclear on if they let you know whether the sequence is correct or not until the end, but I would assume if the clock stops you know you're right"
Blocks World for Teams,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There's only one correct answer
Blocks World for Teams,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Blocks World for Teams,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,The description doesn't say if teammates can communicate in any way.
Blocks World for Teams,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,They have to work together to deliver the right sequence.
Blocks World for Teams,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,I'm not really clear if each participant is assigned a color specifically or as long as someone picks up the required color that it is okay.
Blocks World for Teams,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,I can see this go either way since there are incorrect blocks you could choose.
Bullard Houses,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I don't really think this applies because they're not working towards a shared goal.
Bullard Houses,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,convincing others/using persuasion techniques are creative
Bullard Houses,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,competing objectives
Bullard Houses,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,two possibilities are possible: meet or not. either is possible but not is the goal.
Bullard Houses,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"in groups where there are multiple people, the financial structures (bonds, mortgages, etc) could be divided"
Bullard Houses,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there will be many ways to disagree/force an impasse
Bullard Houses,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"there will be varying opinions and reasoning, can only verify that an agreement wasn't reached"
Bullard Houses,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"requires hiding information from others, perspective/opinion/persuasion that AI cannot do"
Bullard Houses,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"no solution, per say, just an agreement or not"
Bullard Houses,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,its about the agreement/interaction and not a concrete answer
Bullard Houses,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"information withheld, trusting others, persuasive techniques"
Bullard Houses,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,It is a negatiin so unsure how you could see best outcome for both grouos
Bullard Houses,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Since the task is logical with the idea of achieving an optimal answer it is not primarily a generation task but it does require brainstorming and more aptly negotiations.
Bullard Houses,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,The task requires creative thinking because each team is trying out strategies to get a fair deal for their side.
Bullard Houses,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,Negotiations involve analysis of data and resolve inherent differences with the teams.
Bullard Houses,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"Since the optimal outcome is an impasse there there is no specific win lose, but there is clear objective for optimal performance as the participants are required to be secretive and achieve a fair deal for their side."
Bullard Houses,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"It says people work in teams with specif goals in mind, so it can be a divide and conquer task."
Bullard Houses,Q11optimizing_elaboration,They need to avoid reaching an  agreement.
Bullard Houses,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There is only one right outcome which is optimal and that is to not achieve an agreement. However while each team takes the side of buyer and seller and plays to defend their interest, the strategies are loosely defined. This opens up several ways to arrive at the outcome."
Bullard Houses,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,The analysis can be double checked .
Bullard Houses,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Requires creative thinking.
Bullard Houses,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"While the best efforts can be put forth to achieve an impasse, there is no specific solution. But the analysis of financials is a fairly objective exercise and judgement can be exercised to arrive at the desired"
Bullard Houses,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Only an optimal outcome exists, but no correct answer."
Bullard Houses,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"The participants can maybe defend their actions or explain their reasoning, but cannot show the solution is right."
Bullard Houses,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,The participants report if the negotiations are settled or not based on realistic financial structures and judgement
Bullard Houses,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,There are subjective parts like defending the interest of the buyer and seller and also objective parts like financial analysis.
Bullard Houses,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Negotiations involve trade offs.
Bullard Houses,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Some parts involve negotiations which cannt be predetermined.
Bullard Houses,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Systematic analysis, negotiations are involved aimed at achieving an impasse, so no aha moment"
Bullard Houses,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,This will depend on whether or not the participant is assigned to a group.
Carter Racing,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,They will be taking in information and planning to proceed with the race or back out
Carter Racing,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,You only lose if you decide to race as you are doomed to fail
Carter Racing,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"The only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race,"
Carter Racing,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It doesn't state anywhere that the task is timed
Carter Racing,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,The only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race
Carter Racing,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,You ask can more data by asking precise questions that can help you to arrive and the correct answer
Carter Racing,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,It's unclear if they inform you whether you get informed that once you start the race you will fail
Carter Racing,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Carter Racing,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,There's only enough info if you ask the correct questions.
Carter Racing,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There are factors about the decision you are not given unless you ask for them
Carter Racing,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,Once you ask for information about the air temperature when the car does NOT experience an engine failure there should be an aha moment causing you to back out of the race
Carter Racing,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"they can ask for info, but it has to be ""precise"", thus my ranking this in the middle."
Carter Racing,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,This is a judgment call that the participant must make (about the data being non-conclusive)
Carter Racing,Q11optimizing_elaboration,The only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race.
Carter Racing,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,The relationship between ambient temperature and O-ring failure is disguised as the relationship between air temperature and car engine failures.
Carter Racing,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The relationship between ambient temperature and O-ring failure is disguised as the relationship between air temperature and car engine failures.
Carter Racing,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,It's a yes/no question. It's comparing a life or death event with one that isn't.
Carter Racing,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This seems an arbitrary decision. It's comparing something life and death with something about money and equating it.
Carter Racing,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,I guess in the context of the study.
Carter Racing,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,I don't think this is objective in real life.
Carter Racing,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"I had trouble, but I don't know if more info would help. One main point of the task is to pick an action that should/should have been taken. But the underlying task is to figure out why, not the actual plan.  So I think it is not a planning task, but a ""figureing out"" task?"
Carter Racing,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,I wasn't sure - in some ways it is creative thinking - seeing what is not there and figureing out what is not there that you need. But that is also very much a logical process and part of a scientific method...
Carter Racing,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"There are lots of ways to think and talk about possibilities, so I went with ""No"" But really the only way to achieve the task is to ask for additional info in a precise way, so maybe it should be a yes?"
Carter Racing,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Seeing the right answer means they also get the additional info that had to be requested to get the right answer, right? Because then, yes. But if the explanation is worded in such a way that the additional info isn't revealed and they also don't get to see that additional info, then it would be a no (based only on the info in the task itself)"
Carter Racing,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"I'm not sure if figuring out the right question to ask here is a ""trick"" or not?"
Carter Racing,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,Not sure as it said you could ask for more information so I said yes
Carter Racing,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They don't know if they get scholarship
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You fail if you predict that the race can go on.
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,A formula can be devised to show the relationship between air temperature and engine failure and show  levels of air  temperatures where engine failures peak.
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,The game involves the dilemma of whether to go ahead with the race or not for cases made for the same. But the objective is to deny the race based on engine failure due to air temperature.
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,"It could be one that requires collaboration, no one person is given all the info, they have to work together to figure out the answer"
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"No, your fighting the data, not other people."
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,either select yes and fail or no and pass
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"I would say yes, because different people in the group are given different data and they have to combine everything together to come up with correct answer"
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There IS a correct answer - dont race, and the data, i interpreted ight, gives that answer"
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"The team must use the collected data to determine whether they should proceed or not, I would assume this would take some brainstorming."
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,In groups there will be several differing viewpoints and there is only one correct answer
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,It is set up as a competition for a sponsorship but there's only one correct answer
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You either get the answer correct or not.
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q10maximizing_elaboration,It doesn't state anywhere that the task is timed
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q11optimizing_elaboration,There is only one correct answer
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"It's a ""right or wrong"" task"
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"You will know it's correct if you back out of the race, you can verify the incorrect answer by trying to race and you'll find out you're guaranteed to fail."
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There's only one correct answer
Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version),Q24eureka_question_elaboration,I think once they start the race if they decide to they realize the game was rigged to fail.
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,it doesn't say you can't work in groups but it doesn't say you can
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,there is a fixed amount of time
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,the distractor cards that are conflicting.
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,they could have accidently used a distractor card and not know until the end if they passed or failed.
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"only after you finish the problem will you know what the ""trick"" is/ distractor cards."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,They will have to take in the information on the cards and brainstorm to determine the correct categories.
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,To determine the groups you will need some form of creativity
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It's unclear if there's a competition between several users, but you are at the least competing to get the 4 groups correct."
Categorization problem,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You only win if you get the 4 groups correct
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Users could try to divide the task so some users take 1-2 groups a piece.
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,You have to get all 4 groups correct or you fail
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,I assume you can try different methods to determine the groups
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There are distractors to try and throw off the players of the game
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,Until they get to the end they will feel unsure if they guess the groups correctly
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Depends on how well the algorithm identifies categories.
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"It seems to me like there'd be some creativity in coming up with categories that objects could belong to, but there's only one objectively correct solution to the problem, so I would say that little creativity is actually involved in this task."
Categorization problem,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Yes, planning is involved yet writing is minimal and memory is essential."
Categorization problem,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"Yes, but in the end I can see that this task is simply categorization and requires no generating of new ideas."
Categorization problem,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Yes, a little.  Creativity is helpful here yet not the full extent of the task."
Categorization problem,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"No, there is one way to successfully complete this task.  All other results will fail."
Categorization problem,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No, all sub-parts are interdependent, so the task is best completed by one individual."
Categorization problem,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"Yes, there is a limited amount of time to complete this task.  It's my experience that the allotted time is usually sufficient yet for some this can still be troublesome.  Because there is a time limit, speed is considered an important goal."
Categorization problem,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"No, there is one acceptable outcome.  This is written in the instructions."
Categorization problem,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No, the instructions help answer this question by stating that there is a specific set of four categories and the 16 card do belong to their associated categories."
Categorization problem,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"No, this is clearly a task that will include some trial and error.  There will be several ways to achieve the same/correct result."
Categorization problem,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"No, it can be shown that a solution is either correct or incorrect."
Categorization problem,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Yes.  I had a problem with this question mostly because I can't imagine how an algorithm can solve the task.  But I do think one could be made to do it.  I could not determine, from the instructions, if the particiant can look at all cards at the same time or if they could see only one card at a time.  I think I see that only one card is shown at a time, but it is not very clearly stated.  This would make a difference."
Categorization problem,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Yes, I did.  The instructions indicate this is a difficult task.  Yet it does not say this task is impossible.  Therefore, besides being lucky, there must be enough information available for participants to come up with the correct answer."
Categorization problem,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No, the distractors are examples of conflicting information in this task.  If I tried to complete this task, I would call them teasers."
Categorization problem,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No, there will be uncertainty by the participants, especially at the early stages of the task."
Categorization problem,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, because I have not attempted this task.  However, I know of no trick and would be uncertain until I was about half way through."
Checkers,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"You can win checkers in a limited, but wide variety of ways.  In some ways it applies here, but there is not one precise outcome other than ""win"" so it doesn't apply."
Checkers,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,some planning involved

Checkers,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,n/a it's a game between 2 people
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"not sure if this applies here, but you either win or lose"
Checkers,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"Technically, checkers is a solved game, so in my opinion there is always a ""best solution"" for it."
Checkers,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"In checkers, one must always plan the initial move and subsequent moves based on the opponent's moves."
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Since an algorithm cannot anticipate the opponent's moves, it would not be effective in this scenario."
Checkers,Q11optimizing_elaboration,To capture all 12 of the opponent's pieces.
Checkers,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Multiple moves to choose from each turn.
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"Playing this game and winning it's not an operation that can be calculated or selected, and there are many, many ways to reach the final goal of removing all the opponent's rounds"
Checkers,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,I had no issue answering this question.
Checkers,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,I'm not really sure if you have all of the computer's pieces just on a technicality because you can block them in and win the game when they have a piece left.
Checkers,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"Mostly mental, but not clear if checker board is virtual or physical so unclear as to how much physical movement needed"
Checkers,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If working as a group different participants will need to work together to determine correct course of action
Checkers,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,competition against computer opponent
Checkers,Q10maximizing_elaboration,There is a time limit so participants would need to work as quickly as possible
Checkers,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I believe a checker master or computer would know if a move is correct or not.
Checkers,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,An algorithm could be programmed to provide the best move based on the other pieces on the board
Checkers,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,There are many different moves that can be made
Checkers,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I believe moves are mostly logical but subjective in that there are multiple moves to choose

Public goods game,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I am unsure if an algorithm could solve this one on one hand because it is more of a social trask, but then again, it is math-based and I wonder if it could find the best way to maximize both individual and group payoffs with a formula."
Public goods game,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I am unsure if this applies to the task as it relies on others to make decisions for themselves and the group to earn the biggest payoff, so it seems like it would be partially logic and partially subjective to me, but I am unsure."
Public goods game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"I question the word ""tradeoff,"" here, as everyone in the group relies on no information on what the other group members plan to contribute or not beforehand so they are essentially guessing whether they themselves should contribute more or less based on no information."
Public goods game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,This involves two conflicting goals between maximizing individual payoff and team payoff.
Public goods game,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,Correct depends on the definition as it can refer to a situation where each goal of the task is reasonably/moderately fulfilled.
Public goods game,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"The key role of social dynamics leads me toward saying no, however, focusing on the goals and maximizing each goal would be something that could be algorithmically programmed."

Space Fortress,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"Again, there are 2 objectives, to maximize points and destroy the space fortress"
Space Fortress,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,There could be different strategies used with tradeoffs
Space Fortress,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,It is hard to know for sure without playing the game
Space Fortress,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,There isn't really a solution or answer.
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Going to say no, mainly because the goal for everyone would be to attack the fortress.  It's possible that maybe someone could be designated to help destroy or neutralize the mines, so that other players could attack the fortress more freely, but I don't think that would help as much and don't see that happening."
Space Fortress,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"The goal is to maximize points by damaging the fortress, and the only way to do that is by hitting it."
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"There really isn't a problem to solve, it's merely an action that players must take."
Space Fortress,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"There really isn't a problem to solve, it's merely an action that players must take."
Space Fortress,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"Yes, this is tricky.  While the object is to attack as much as possible, there is a mental side that requires strategy.  Neither physical nor mental actions alone will result in best performance."
Space Fortress,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,No.  There is a best strategy for success in this task.  There is possibly more than one best strategy.
Space Fortress,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Yes, because the creativity required is intermixed with the physical effort to do repeated damage to the fortress."
Space Fortress,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"A little trouble, yes.  But the instructions do indicate an evaluation if performance at the conclusion of the task.  So, a comparison to others seems to happen."
Space Fortress,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,No.  Points are earned during the task and total scores are evaluated.  This means that any points earned may be used to determine payout.
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"No.  Multiple players have an overall advantage, so the help is appreciated."
Space Fortress,Q10maximizing_elaboration,No.  There is no mention of a time limit here.  The goal is to destroy the fortress.  The game will end when that happens or if your own ship is destroyed.
Space Fortress,Q11optimizing_elaboration,No.  There is an outcome to be achieved but it is not a precision task.
Space Fortress,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"No.  Although the best solution is to destroy the fortress, there could be many ways to achieve this."
Space Fortress,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,No.
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,No.  The solution will be evident to all once achieved.
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,No.  This is a video game that responds to programmed stimuli.  An algorithm is often designed to achieve success in these situations.
Space Fortress,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"No.  There is a finite number of obstructions to tend to, so it seems nothing more is needed."
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"No.  If one is successful with this task, it could be explained how each obstacle was overcome."
Space Fortress,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"No, although a""objectively correct solution"" may not be the normal wording for this type of task."
Space Fortress,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,No.  This is an objective task.
Space Fortress,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No.  Points are important, but the real goal is to destroy the fortress.  That is the object.  Any lesser achievement is objectively not as good and can be easily graded.  So, room for compromises are extremely limited."
Space Fortress,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No.  Any new participants to this task will not be absolutely sure their strategy will be successful.  However, experienced participants will at least know what did not work well in past attempts."
Space Fortress,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"Yes, this is tricky so let me explain.  There are many obstacles, some of them move and we do not know the speed of the task items.  Unknowns are a real problem.  A plan of action could arise after experimentation where outer mines are dealt with first.  Or, the plan may be to ignore the mines and concentrate on the fortress while taking evasive action.  In either case, skill and dexterity become essential.  Therefore, I'd say the many approaches to this task are more important to realize than trying to discover an ""aha"" moment where one strategy will win all or most of the time."
Space Fortress,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"The set-up and object do not describe how participants navigate, either through keyboard, joystick or perhaps mental telepathy."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,I don't have a sense of the degree of planning or strategy involved to avoid mines and take down the fortress.
Space Fortress,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,It's unclear how much of the success depends on strategy or luck or finger twitches.
Space Fortress,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,I'm not sure if there is a trick to this game basedon the information providedl
Space Fortress,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There are different ways to achieve the outcome, but the goal is to destroy the fortress, which is a precise outcome, right?"
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"Doing this in this case would be tedious, but it could be done, couldn't it?"
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"I don't really know what robots or algorithms can do, but since this isn't a creative task, this seems like something they can be programmed to accomplish."
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,Hmmm.  I'm not 100% sure on this one.
Space Fortress,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"There are multiple ways to accomplish the goal, but each one can be proven to be successful (although it would be laborious)."
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Since it can be played either single-player or multiplayer, I think this question is not answerable, unless we know if it's gonna be single or multi. If multi, then the answer would be yes and if single, then no. So it all depends on the mode."
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"Not too sure this is applicable. It's a video game and while I suppose it could be written, I'll just go with it not being answerable."
Space Fortress,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."
Space Fortress,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"I don't think questions regarding ""solutions"" are applicable to this task, since it's just a video game where you try to score the most points."

Space Fortress,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"I don't think this question applies given the task, so I left the answer in the middle."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,Some physically in using the controls for the game.
Space Fortress,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Participants can divide which sides of the ship to attack from.
Space Fortress,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Destroying the fortress would be the ""correct"" answer."
Space Fortress,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This task requires good eye-hand coordination.
Space Fortress,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,There is a single player and multi-player version so it depends on which one
Splitting a deck of cards,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,You can have a good idea that you're right
Splitting a deck of cards,Q10maximizing_elaboration,"To get a better score on the task, participants have to understand what the pattern is as fast as they can."

Splitting a deck of cards,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"You're looking to get the maximum amount of point, it's not pass/fail"
Splitting a deck of cards,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is timed and you're trying to guess the rules in as few turns as possible
Splitting a deck of cards,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"You have to identify the rules or you lose, the outcome is precise"
Splitting a deck of cards,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,To guess exactly right in the fewest amount of turns possible would be the best way

Splitting a deck of cards,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Sudoku,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Still unsure if time limit alone is enough to make this a yes answer or not.
Sudoku,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,You have to coordinate the number so they don't conflict between the rows/columns

Sudoku,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,You may think a number works for a row but conflicts with another column
Sudoku,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,They are working e=with chat box and may recieve different information from others but I dont think there is a trade off
Summarize Discussion,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"It's a fine line and I'm not sure about this answer.  There are conflicting solutions and pieces of information that come from the participants, not necessarily from the task."
Summarize Discussion,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"Since there is no objective answer, the issue of uncertainty is really around whether they have written a quality argument."
Summarize Discussion,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This scenario requires active discussion so there is physical effort involved.
Summarize Discussion,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,All submitted written arguments favoring or opposing the question will be subjective.
Summarize Discussion,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"There is no absolute answer to the subject they are opposing or advocating for, there is just a written response with arguments in favor or against."
Summarize Discussion,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,I think it is somewhat creative as people need to create arguments
Summarize Discussion,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,There is not a right or wrong answer because it is fully subjective
Summarize Discussion,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"There is not a solvable problem, fully subjective"

Target Search,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,There is some creativity in the first guess then how to proceed based on feedback
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I couldn’t even think how you would break this into independent subparts
Target Search,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"There is a “max” or best, but VERY unlikely"
Target Search,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There is a whole range of possible point totals
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"This was hard to answer, cause it’s just getting points as opposed to a “solution”"
Target Search,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,"no, you have to reconsider the coordinates depending on the feedback you get"
Target Search,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"no, because they have to analyze very coordinate"
Target Search,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,you have to plan what coordinates to choose and plan other coordinates depending on the values they get
Target Search,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"maybe, ideas have to be considered to think where the center of the target"
Target Search,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"no, because being creative does not show you the logical cells that you have chosen to get near a target"
Target Search,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"no, its not a win or lose situation its more of an analysis situation"
Target Search,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"no, because here you have to search for as many high values cells as possible"
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"no, because the sub parts would have to depend from the feedback given from the answer they gave before"
Target Search,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"no, because you would have to give the right coordinates to achieve the goal"
Target Search,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"Initially you may not plan your first strike, but afterwards you would plan out where you think the next best point of attack would be."
Target Search,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Your team would want to map out your next strike
Target Search,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"

Target Search,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Target Search,Q11optimizing_elaboration,There is a precise answer you're wanting to get but it's almost impossible to achieve.  But it is graded on a gradient scale
Target Search,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,Guessing exactly right would be difficult but it's the best solution
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,You will know right after you pick your target how close you are and how many points you got
Target Search,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Target Search,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,You receive feedback to let you know if you were right.
Target Search,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Target Search,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I think if you have data to support you could prove that it is best to choose a certain method to find the target
Target Search,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,Since participants are told their point value I think they could prove their choices correct or not
Target Search,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,I think the AHA moment is when you click or choose a cell worth points and have identified part of the target
Target Search,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"No, since trial and error is likely involved."
Target Search,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No, since the goal is to get the most points."
The beer game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Sounds like there are information delays, but everyone should still try to work together as much as possible."
The beer game,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Minimize costs
The beer game,Q11optimizing_elaboration,Ideal goal is zero costs
The beer game,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,Sounds like zero costs is achievable.
The beer game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,seems more collaborative as a team
The beer game,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"doesn't mention what happens if an extensive error, no money, etc. multiple ways to meet the objective."
The beer game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,each player already is given a specialty
The beer game,Q10maximizing_elaboration,having the smallest costs
The beer game,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"the least amount of cost/damage/penalty is the ""best"" outcome"
The beer game,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"it's random every turn so there could be multiple ""best"" solutions to get to the desired result"
The beer game,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"if given the parameters and variables, an AI could deduce what the best cost would be - but if they are random and after the fact, it would only be a best guess estimation"
The beer game,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,you must guess based on what the random external factors will be and other players decisions
The beer game,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,it should be obvious which decisions carry the most penalties
The Fish game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It wasn’t quite clear whether they would be competing against each other, or just against a “max points”"
The Fish game,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"This is also iffy. There is a max score but it’s not clear if there is one or many ways. The description says there is trial and error, so that made this question harder to answer."
The Fish game,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,This task requires mental effort and motor skills to move cursor.
The Fish game,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,Participants have to decide whether to explore other areas in the room or plan on where to go next.
The Fish game,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"Touching the wall means you lose all your points but if they don't touch it they still accumulate points so it is not an ""all or nothing"" scenario"
The Fish game,Q10maximizing_elaboration,Participants try to get as many points as possible before the time limit expires.
The Fish game,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This game is by trial and error. You try to find the room offering the highest rewards.
The Fish game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Participants can explore other locations in the same room and possibly not get any points or they can explore other areas for higher points or possibly zero points.
The Fish game,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,I suppose in theory there is a solution where there is a maximized number of points that could be achieved in the playing field but it was not completely clear from the description
The Fish game,Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,"I suppose there is an outcome that would objectively have the highest score possible in the field, but I wasn't certain of this based on the information."
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,no teams
The Fish game,Q2intel_manip_1_elaboration,"It's not clear how much clicking is involved or what it takes to move from one location to another. This isn't a straight clicking task, but requires thinking about where to go more than actual movement."
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Each participant controls their own cursor
The Fish game,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,since trial and error or luck is involved I think it is not applicable
The Fish game,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,This relies on the participant properly exploring.
The Fish game,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,This depends on knowing the highest possible points.
The Fish game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,There is nothing to divide since each participant is playing separately

The N light bulbs game,Q6type_5_cc_elaboration,If they are working as a team
The N light bulbs game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I struggled with this one. I couldn’t see how something like this could be subdivided but I suppose it’s possible.
The N light bulbs game,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,There could be 1 or more solutions that give the highest possible points
The N light bulbs game,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"While there is a way to finish the task without getting the maximum points, the max is the goal and therefore only one correct answer"
The N light bulbs game,Q11optimizing_elaboration,there is a best configuration but participants won't be told if they achieved it

To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"This task has an all-or-nothing element. If you choose not to evacuate and disaster strikes, you lose everything."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,They make their selection for evacuation individually.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q11optimizing_elaboration,The goal here is to choose or not to choose to evacuate. It is either or so the participants are asked to choose between two precise outcomes.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,The best solution here is to choose not to evacuate and avert disaster to earn a high reward.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,This is a binary choice...yes or no.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"Task only states bonus/rewards are managed based on evacuate decision. Does participant start off with a certain amount of points? Also, it can be argue that both yes and no are applicable due to player having a choice to how the bonus is earning. In order words lets assuming the player decides to play it safe and evacuate every time, will the participant still walk away with something?"
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"We don't know if the risk level of the disaster is guarantee a disaster or not. Even at 90% risk, there is still 10% chance that a disaster won't happen and the system may go with the 10%"

To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,"This task is more of a educated guess on probability. Therefore, it has a bit of both. But since there are information to help with the estimate, I would say it still has a little more objectiveness over subjectiveness."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I took the goal as precise, to avoid the disaster."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I went back and forth on this one, I could see it going either way but if someone wants to avoid risk, the best solution might be evacuating even if a disaster does not strike."
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I think an algorithm could be set up here to choose whether to evacuate or stay based on the risk level.
To evacuate or not to evacuate,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,I think there is an element of a participant's risk tolerance in coming up with the best solution.

But since it also didn't say that a participant (or group of participants) with the highest score would be a winner if they maximized their score, I think I answered ""No"" correctly. But it was a bit confusing as most trivia quizes are part of competitive games irl."
Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"It wasn't specified in the task if the participants would be working together on a team or each doing their own quiz. And it wasn't speficied if the questions would be presented one after another (as real life trivia games often do) or if you could pick and choose from the whole list at once. So I was very unconfident. I went with they would all be working gether from a page of questions, and so could split them up to be more efficient."

Trivia Multiple Choice Quiz,Q19time_solvability_elaboration,"I wasn't sure if the ""infinite resources"" part meant that a person could look up authoritative answers and show them to someone as proof that the solution was right. That would break the rules of the task, but maybe could be done as part of the scoring/explanation process after the task?  It wasn't clear if this question referred to the task itself or was just asking in general."

Unscramble words (anagrams),Q20type_3_type_4_elaboration,No.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,No.  This is clearly stated in the instructions.
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"No.  Conflicts can only appear if the participant enters an incorrect solution (one that is not a real word).  In this case, overall knowledge of the language is the culprit, not conflicting answers."
Unscramble words (anagrams),Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"No.  Some participants will not arrive at the correct solution immediately yet insert a likely answer out of desperation or ""best guess"".  They may hope it is right, but will need to wait for verification."

Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,"In this scenario, the participant could be certain if he sees an oddball Gabor patch or he could not so, I believe this question is NA."
Visual Oddball Target,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"All participants are working individually, otherwise ""yes"""
Visual Oddball Target,Q1concept_behav_elaboration,There is a physiological aspect to visual perception - someone with poor vision due to a physical ailment may struggle more with this visual perception task - so it was a little harder to define for me.
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"I struggled somewhat with this one because there is only one correct answer to each grouping, however it isn't possible to get close to the correct answer without actually being correct, so it doesn't seem like precision is the right concept to describe it"
Visual Oddball Target,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It is not clear whether participants get feedback on their responses immediately or not
Visual Oddball Target,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,Because there's some visualization required there may be a fraction of creativity needed.
Visual Oddball Target,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,Since you either identify the oddball or not I think it's an all or nothing task
Visual Oddball Target,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Visual Oddball Target,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"You have to identify the oddball or you lose, the outcome is precise"
Visual Oddball Target,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,Because it's a visual task I would assume it's purely a human task

Volunteer Investment Game,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Participants must decide when to invest vs. waiting out for a bigger payoff
Volunteer Investment Game,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,I don't really think this applies here because just one single individual can influence the outcome for everyone.
Volunteer Investment Game,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,goal is to maximize profit but there are two goals at the expense of others.

Wildcat Wells,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,"From the description it sounds like guess work, so, although it is sytematic, there is no way for n algorythim to find the best solution."
Wildcat Wells,Q17within_sys_sol_elaboration,"Ther is nothing that leads the participant to knwo what is the best method, sounds like a guessing game.."
Wildcat Wells,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Again, it is guessing."
Wildcat Wells,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,unknown
Wildcat Wells,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,unknown-maybe the highest # of points can be gotten in different ways
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,Although it does involve planning I'm not sure there would be so many variations on the answer that it would qualify as a brainstorming task.
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,"There is only a few ways to accomplish the task, and it either works or you fail"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q10maximizing_elaboration,Because you're trying to accomplish the task in as few trips as possible
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there are a few different scenarios that will accomplish the task but not many
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,There aren't a huge amount of way to do it but there's more than one
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Once you understand the rules I don't think they conflict
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,"It is ""planning"", but there's not any writing, really"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,"the elaboration here is unclear. there are literally ""tradeoffs"" here."
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q24eureka_question_elaboration,"the ""aha"" or ""trick"" is explained in the objective/goal"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,there are 2 solutions
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,"2 ways to solve, so, not ""many"" and not one"
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer",Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Word completion given part of word,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,I think users would be naturally brainstorming on all possible words that could be formed with the available letters.
Word completion given part of word,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"
Word completion given part of word,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,You either get the answer correct or not.
Word completion given part of word,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Word completion given part of word,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"It's a ""right or wrong"" task"
Word completion given part of word,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Word completion given part of word,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,If you know what the word is you'll know that you got it correct or not
Word completion given part of word,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,It seems unclear if the participants will be notified if they got the answers correct or not
Word completion given part of word,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"The closer to 36 completed correctly, the better."
Word completion given part of word,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They probably have an idea on how they are doing but would not know for sure.
Word completion given part of word,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"One word might be completed in different ways, and the task doesn't say if there is always just one possible right solution (a word can be completed correctly in many ways)"
Word completion given part of word,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"Is this a group exercise, or individual?"
Word completion given part of word,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,Based on the instructions I believe this is an individual task and not a group task.
Word completion given part of word,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,For some words I think there could be multiple solutions so participants may not know until the end if their answer was correct
Word completion given part of word,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,It was a little confusing with the info provided.
Word completion given starting letter,Q11optimizing_elaboration,Does creating the maximum number of valid words in a specific time a precise outcome?
Word completion given starting letter,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,some may be unsure if they wrote an invalid word but thought it was valid when doing it.
Word completion given starting letter,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,"I wasn't entirely clear if I should account for whether it is reasonable or not. There are only so many words in the English language, and so I finite numbr of words that start and end with 2 given letter. So there is a theoretical maximum number of words and with enough time time a group could get them all. But it is very unlikely, especially not in a reasonable time limit. So..."
Word completion given starting letter,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,"is this question asking if one specific solution (word here) can be judged as correct, or whether the group of words as a whole can be judged as correct? As in, is the group all possible words matching the ruleset?"
Word completion given starting letter,Q18ans_recog_elaboration,"Again, are you asking about one answer within the group of answers, the group as a whole being all of the possible words that match the rules. Because, yes, you can know one word fits, but you can't know if all of the words have been found..."
Word completion given starting letter,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,No team work
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"Team or participant 1 can come up with 10 words while the other team comes up with 9. In this case, team 1 wins or gets the most points."
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q10maximizing_elaboration,The teams/participants are to come up with as many words as possible.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q22confl_tradeoffs_elaboration,Either the answers submitted are valid four-letter words or they are not.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,The answer here is objective and there is no trickery involved.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q3type_1_planning_elaboration,Because the letter pop up once the timer starts it would be difficult to plan for the task
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q4type_2_generate_elaboration,"It states ""Those working in teams can brainstorm in any way they wish"""
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,"Although there are set words to create, you have to think outside the box to come up with certain word"
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q7type_7_battle_elaboration,"It is unclear if there's a competition or not, since the goal is to maximize points I assume it's against another person or team"
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q8type_8_performance_elaboration,It's based on the highest score not pass/fail
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q9divisible_unitary_elaboration,"I assume everyone would try to use all letter to generate what they can, I don't think the task can be divided."
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q10maximizing_elaboration,It is a timed task
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q11optimizing_elaboration,"There is a precise number that you can get, but it is graded on a gradient scale"
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q13outcome_multip_elaboration,Coming up with all possible solutions would be the best
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q15dec_verifiability_elaboration,If the words can be verified to be actual words it's correct
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q16shared_knowledge_elaboration,I would assume that an algorithm could solve this
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q21intellective_judg_1_elaboration,Since you have to confirm whether or not they're actual words I would think it's objective.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,They may think they've created a word but may not know it's incorrect until after it's over
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q5creativity_input_1_elaboration,it is not really creative to generate a list of words that someone is already familiar with-but involves the same mental effort
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q11optimizing_elaboration,all words generated must be 4 letters and english
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q14sol_scheme_mul_elaboration,a person could simply generate random four letter combinations.
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q23ss_out_uncert_elaboration,the intellectual ability of the participant can actually be enough to know every possible four letter word in the english language.( not me though)
Word construction from a subset of letters,Q24eureka_question_elaboration,what is the trick?-is there always a trick?
