# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> There were individual and group versions of the task
> > Individuals completed the Optimization task three times. A different underlying function was used each time

# Procedure
## Steps
Pretest: All participants took two tests, a shortened version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and a short version of the Big 5 inventory

As the participants arrived, they were assigned to groups of three. Participants were ordered according to their mean performance across the individual problem-solving tasks (Memory, Optimization
and Shapes), and ordered as higher-skill, medium-skill, and lower-skill

Individual:
> Step one: Participants were given a function, which was hidden to them, and had 15 guesses to find the maximum
> 
> > Guesses had to be between 0 and 300
> > 
> Step two: Once participants had entered 15 guesses, they were asked to submit their answer for the input value that maximized the output

Group
> Step one: Each group of three people worked face-to-face in a single room. The tasks were computer based and each participant was provided with a laptop. We began each group session by asking group members to
introduce themselves. 
>
> Step two: Then, groups were required to nominate a ‘Reporter’. The Reporter was responsible for entering their group’s answers. Participants also gathered around the Reporter’s laptop
for some tasks.
>
> Step three: Participants were given a function, which was hidden to them, and each participant had 5 guesses to find the maximum (for a group total of 15)
> > Each group member entered their own guesses on their own laptop
> > Each group solved the Optimization task twice

## Roles 
> In the group, one participant was the Reporter, who entered the group’s answer for the output-maximizing input after each participant in the group submitted their own guesses

## Instructions
ASK 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

## Incentives
> Participants who completed the study were paid a total of $100: $10 for completing the individual tests; $30 for lab visit 1; and $60 for lab visit 2.
