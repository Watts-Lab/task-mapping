# Stimuli
## The visual components
>The search environment for the participants was an NK-model in which the N represented the number of binary dimensions (which was fixed at 10) and K represented varying levels of ruggedness.
>>The 10 dimensions of the landscape were represented as 10 light bulbs that could be either on or off

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
There were eight conditions that consisted of smooth and rugged landscapes (K=1 or K=8), low or high individual's degrees of freedom (DoF=3 or DoF=6) and transmission chain or independent group.
# Procedure
## Steps
>Participants were instructed to search for the best possible solution in a NK-landscape.
>>To facilitate the visual representation, 10 lightbulbs represented the 10 dimensions of the landscape and could be turned either on or off
>>Not all light bulbs could be manipulated, since the individual's degrees of freedom varied which allowed only a limited number of randomly selected dimensions to be manipulated
>In each round, the participant could change the state of one light bulb
>After their decision, they were informed about their new payoff and were allowed to return to their previous solution before a new round started
>Each participant played a total of 128 levels (16 landscapes per the 8 experimental conditions)
## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Payoffs in each landscape were normalized by dividing them by the maximal achievable payoff and using a monotonic transformation to raise each payoff to the power of eight
> Each participants payoff is determined by which manipulations correspond to the underlying NK-landscapes

## Incentives
Participants received a flat fee of 8€ plus a monetary bonus based on their total performance (0.16 € per 1000 points, mean bonus = 6.65 €, SD = 1.11€)
