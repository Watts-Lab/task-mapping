# Summary
In this experiment each subject is given a card on which there appears a set of five (out of six possible) symbols. Each subject's card is different from all the others in that the symbol lacking is a different symbol in each case. Thus, in any set of five cards there is only one symbol in common. The task is for every subject to find the common symbol.

Questionnaire questions:
- How much did you enjoy your job?
- Did your group have a leader, if so who?
- Describe briefly the organization of your group.
- How did you like your job in the group?
- See if you can recall how you felt about thejob as you went along. Draw the curve below.
- Was there anything at any time that kept your group from performing its best? If so, what?
- Do you thinly your group could improve its efficiency? If so, how?
- Rate your group on the scale below

# Procedure
## Steps

1. One hundred male undergraduates of M.I.T., 8 drawn from various classes at the Institute, served as subjects for these experiments.

2. These 100 are split up into 20 groups of five men each. These 20 groups are then further subdivided so that five groups could be tested on each of four experimental patterns.

3. In case the color or geographical position of one's work-space might affect one's behavior, positions are shifted for each new group.

4. Each group is given 15 consecutive trials on one pattern, a process which required one session of about fifty minutes. These subjects are not used again. The order in which the patterns are used is randomized.
  - The 5 participants were seated around a circular table so that each was separated from the next by a vertical partition from the center to six inches beyond the table's edge.
  - Partitions had slots permitting subjects to push written message cards to the men on either side of them.

  - To allow for communication to the other men in the group, a five-layered pentagonal box was built and placed at the center of the table. The box was placed so that the partitions just touched each of the five points of the pentagon. Each ofthe five resulting wedge-shaped work-spaces was then painted a different color.
  - The 5 subjects were supplied with blank message cards whose colors matched that of their work spaces. Any message sent from a booth had to be on a card of the booth's color.
  - On the left wall of each partition, 16 large symbol cards, representing 16 trials, were hung in loose-leaf fashion. The cards were placed in order with numbered backs to S. At the starting signal could pull down the first card and go to work.
  - In addition, each work space was provided with a board on which were mounted six switches. Above each switch appeared one of the six symbols. When a subject got an answer to the problem, he was to throw the proper switch, which would turn on an appropriate light on a master board of 30 lights in the observer's room.
  - Each subject is given a card on which there appear a set of five (out of six possible) symbols. Each subject's card is different from all the others in that the symbol lacking, the sixth one, is a different symbol in each case. Thus, in any set of five cards there is only one symbol in common.
  - The problem is for every member to find the common symbol. To accomplish this, each member is allowed to communicate, by means of written messages, with those other members of the group to whom he has an open channel.
  - A subject who has discovered the answer is allowed to pass the answer along.
  
5. When five lights (whether or not they were under the correct symbol), representing five different 5 subjects, were lit, the observer called a halt to the trial.   - The observer could tell by a glance at the light panel whether (a) five different 5 subjects had thrown their switches, (b) whether all five had decided on the same answer, and (c)whether the answer decided on was right or wrong.
  - The same detailed instructions were given to all 5 subjects. A preliminary series of four problems, in which each 5 was given all the information required for solution, was used. This was done to note the extent of differences among 5 subjects in the time required to solve such problems.
  
6. After a group has completed its 15 trials, and before members are permitted to talk with one another, each member is asked to fill out a questionnaire.

## Roles 

Participants were broken into groups of 5 and asked to find the common symbol on their cards.

## Instructions

Instruction written by CSSLab:

Thank you for participating in our experiment today. We want to investigate the relationship between the behavior of small groups and the patterns of their communication. You will need to complete 15 consecutive trials in this experiment.

Each of you will be given a card with a set of five out of six symbols and the symbol missing in your card is different from that of all the others'. Thus, in any five cards given to you in a trial there is only one symbol in common. The task for you is to work together to find the common symbol. In order to communicate with your fellow team members you can pass notes through slots permitting you to push written message cards to the persons on either side of you.

To allow for communication to the other members of the group, a five-layered pentagonal box is at the center of the table. The box was placed so that the partitions just touched each of the five points of the pentagon. Each of the five resulting work spaces was painted a different color. You have been supplied with blank message cards whose colors matched those of your work spaces. Any message sent from a booth had to be on a card of the booth's color.

Each of you are allowed to pass the answer along once you get the answer. When you get the answer, please switch the light to indicate that you finished. The trial will end once everyone lit the light.

When finished solving the problem:

Please fill out this short questionnaire before you have any communication with other participants.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

- Times (Time Required for Solution):
  Group time (seconds) spent for a correct trial.

- Messages (Number of Communications):
  A count of the number of messages sent by each group during a given (correct) trial. Every separate written communication from one 5 (A) to another (B) is considered one message.

- Errors (Number of incorrect switch):
  An error was defined as the throwing of any incorrect switch by a subject during a trial. Errors that were not corrected before the end of a trial are labelled "final errors"; the others are referred to as "corrected errors."

## Incentives
