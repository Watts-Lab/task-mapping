# Summary
Participants in dyads were assigned to tag three pairs of foreign objects ("greebles") versus six lone distractor greebles in a computer maze.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations. 

If no visual components are provided or seem not to be needed describe an interface for executing this task in an online environment with remote participants. 


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants completed an online pre-screening composed of: (1) the Visualizer–Verbalizer Cognitive Style Questionnaire (VVCSQ), (2) the Object–Spatial Imagery and Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ). The goal of the screening was to select individuals from the tails of the distributions for object visualization and spatial visualization, and choose individuals who were high only on one of the two visualization cognitive styles, and not both, in order to compose maximally diverse or homogenous teams.
2. Participants were told that they would be participating in a group collaboration study. 
3. Participants were paired in a dyad that was either homogenous or diverse.
4. Participants were assigned either a "navigator" role or a "tagger" role. In the diverse condition, the individual high in spatial visualization was given the role of the navigator, and the individual high in object visualization was assigned the role of a tagger. In the homogeneous conditions, these roles were randomly assigned.
5. Dyads viewed the virtual maze environment on a single monitor, and had access to just one keyboard and one joystick. They were instructed to tag identical "greebles" which are foreign objects. Each maze had 12 greebles, 3 pairs of identical greebles and 6 lone distractor greebles.
6. Once the participants were introduced and seated in their assigned positions, they viewed task instructions on the computer monitor and navigated two small practice mazes. During this practice period, dyads received feedback when they correctly tagged the greeble pair in each maze. Such feedback was not given later on in the study.
7. Following the practice period, dyads navigated two mazes. Participants were not allowed to communicate while working on Maze 1, but they were allowed to discuss the task freely for 2 min between Maze 1 and Maze 2. Dyads were mointored by 2 raters and scored on amount of discussion and details.

## Roles 
Tagger: Tags the identical greebles using the keyboard 

Navigagtor: Navigates through the computer maze using the joystick.

## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

If the instructions are not available ask the paper's authors, however and if that fails, write new ones that appear as suitable as possible.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance was calculated by the number of errors. Errors in this context consisted of tagging greebles that should not have been tagged. Two factors affected the commission of errors—the degree to which the dyad navigated the maze well, so that each greeble that appeared on the screen was in a unique part of the maze, and the degree to which the dyad recognized whether a greeble had been seen before or not. Thus both object and spatial visualization influenced the number of errors committed. Our analyses focused on the percent of greebles incorrectly tagged.


## Incentives
Participants were guaranteed a base pay, to which a bonus based on performance was added. The bonuses received ranged from $0 to $6.80, above the base pay promised.
