# Stimuli
## The visual components
Video stimuli and questions unavailable from researchers- will need to be developed by CSS lab  


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Each of the 68 groups was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: face-to-face or online. 
2. All participants were seated in front of personal laptop computers and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the tasks described below. 
> Each face-to-face group was seated in a private room around a small table and was allowed to communicate freely. Members in the online groups were randomly seated in a large room with members of other groups. They did not know who else was in their group, and they only communicated with their group members via text chat in the shared online system. 
3. The entire group task battery was completed in just under an hour. Then all subjects completed individual tests i.e. the Recall Videos task and individual personality scales.
> The total time for all memory tasks was 11 minutes.
