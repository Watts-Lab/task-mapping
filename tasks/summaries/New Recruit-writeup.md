# New Recruit

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired for the negotiation over mock job recruitment. They are randomly assigned the role of either the recruit or the recruiter.

Here is an example to help you imagine what the negotiation might look like. Participants would receive a list of settlement options for each issue, and the payoff (in points) associated with each option. They would see only their own payoff schedule, and would not be aware of their counterparts'. Participants would then conduct negotiations over the employment package.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are explicitly instructed that their goal is to maximize their (individual) payoff, and were given 30 minutes to conduct their negotiation. In order for any agreement to be binding, participants need to reach an agreement on all the issues.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.
