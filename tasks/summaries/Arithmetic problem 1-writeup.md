# Arithmetic problem 1

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see a hypothetical story problem about five people who operate five machines. The problem reads as follows:

You are a five man team whose job it is to manufacture a product, the completion of which requires the operation of five machines. In the past, you have rotated positions to avoid boredom, but each man has spent most of the time operating the machine that he prefers. John prefers machine 3, Steve machine 2, Walt machine 4, Robert machine 1, and Dennis machine 5. 

The Methods man has been around checking the time each man requires to complete the operation on one product when he is operating each of the five machines. He has come up with the following results:

|        | Machine 1 | Machine 2 | Machine 3 | Machine 4 | Machine 5 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| John   | 3 min     | 3 min     | 4 min     | 3.5 min   | 4.5 min   |
| Steve  | 2 min     | 2 min     | 5 min     | 2.5 min   | 3.5 min   |
| Walt   | 1 min     | 2 min     | 5 min     | 2 min     | 1.5 min   |
| Robert | 4 min     | 1 min     | 3 min     | 3.5 min   | 3 min     |
| Dennis | 5 min     | 3 min     | 2 min     | 5 min     | 3 min     |

Your foreman has noticed that when each man runs the machine that he most prefers, the total time spent on each product is 16 minutes. It seems to him that a different method of operation would result in substantial savings. He believes in letting his workers make their own decision, in so far as possible, and has asked that you consider the problem and try to come up with a plan that will be more efficient than the present mode of operation.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to pair each man with one of the machines, such that the amount of time it takes to manufacture the product is minimized.

There is exactly one right answer to this problem --- it is to put Walt on machine 5, Steve on machine 4, Dennis on machine 3, Robert on machine 2, and John on machine 1. In the optimal answer, the total time to create the product is 10 minutes.

Participants have a limited amount of time to submit their answers. Those working in groups can discuss their answers before submitting in an online portal.

The task is graded based on how close a submission is to the true minimum time for creating the product. Submitting the correct answer (10 minutes) will give participants the highest possible score; a solution that builds the product in 11 minutes will get more points than a solution that builds the product in 15 minutes.
