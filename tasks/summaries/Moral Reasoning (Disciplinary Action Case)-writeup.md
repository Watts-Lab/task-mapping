# Moral Reasoning (Disciplinary Action Case)

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants read a fictitious, controversial case in which a college basketball player bribed an instructor to change his grade on an exam in order to maintain his eligibility on the team.

Participants are also given a list of potential actions that the college could take in response, in which the student and/or instructor could be given a punishment or consequence. Examples include:

 (1.) Lowering Student's Grade
 (2.) Student Suspension
 (3.) Punishment from Student's Basketball Team
 (4.) Instructor Punishment
 (5.) Preventing the Instructor from Getting Future Position and/or Promotion
 
These possible courses of action are further challenged by conflicting interests of the faculty, college administration, and the athletic department.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Although there is no right or wrong course of action among the options, the goal is to select one of the courses of action.

Participants had to try to make sense of the different stakeholders' conflicting interests, get agreement from team members, and make a final choice about how to handle the disciplinary situation.
