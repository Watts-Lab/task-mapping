# Visual Oddball Target

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex
Participants see several groupings of visual stimuli. For example, they might get a series of Gabor patches. These are circular-shaped patterns with black and white bars oriented in the same direction; the patterns are often used in psychological research because they can create an optical illusion, making for a challenging visual perception task. The participants might get several groups of 6 such patches.

Sometimes, one of the visual items might be an “oddball” (it looks different than the rest). In this case, if participants see 6 patches at a time, the oddball would be a Gabor patch with different level of contrast (it’s darker) or have a different pattern than the other 5.

## 2. Goal Directives
The goal is to visually identify when there is an oddball versus when there is not.

The task is focused on visual perception: participants see a grouping, and then need to decide whether one patch looks different than all the others.  They submit their decision by pressing a button using their mouse or a keyboard within a fixed amount of time.

For example, if participants see a group of 6 Gabor patches, they would press a mouse or a keyboard button when there is an oddball and press nothing when all patches in the group look the same.

There are only two possible outcomes of task performance. Participants can either correctly identify the oddball or not.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes

### Skills 
Visual attention, reaction, estimation.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Independent condition: view screen, press a button.
Influence (group) condition: view screen, press button, agree or disagree with partner's response, discuss different decisions with partner, make a joint decision if individual ones were different.

### Other Allowed Processes
