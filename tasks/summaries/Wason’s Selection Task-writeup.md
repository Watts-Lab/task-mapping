# Wason’s Selection Task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given two cards with conditional sentences, such as “if there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side” and “if there is a 3 on one side of any card, then there is a D on its other side.” Participants are also given four cards with letters and numbers. For example, cards could have the following letters and numbers on the front and back respectively: D and 3, 3 and K, B and 5, 7 and D.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to select cards that allow to determine whether the given conditional sentence is true or false.

Participants are evaluated on the correctness of their reasoning as there is only solution that can be deducted logically and objectively. If participants turn over cards that allow to determine the truth value of a conditional, then they solve the task correctly. If they select not enough cards or they select the right cards but also extra cards that do not allow to determine the truth value of a coditional, participants fail the task.
