# Abstract grid task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants were given a grid, in which some squares in the grid were colored in, and other squares in the grid were not colored in. The grid was interactive, and offered the opportunity to change the squares' colors by either "adding" color where a square was not filled in, or "substracting" color where a square was already filled in (removing the color from the square).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to make the grid appear symmetrical from left-to-right and top-to-bottom using the fewest number of clicks. (Each click represented one manipulation --- either adding or subtracting color from the grid.)

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
