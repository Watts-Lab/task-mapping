# Whac-A-Mole

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex
Participants were given a screen with a bunch of colored moving targets (circles) and an ability to click or "hit" the targets as they moved around.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants' goal was to hit targets based on their point value, thereby maximizing their points. They also had to reach their targets more quickly than an opponent (i.e., try to beat them by hitting more targets and getting more points).
