# NASA Moon survival

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants view information describing a survival scenario in which a space ship crashes on the moon. The survivors are able to salvage a list of 15 items (e.g., matches, food concentrate, a 50-foot nylon rope, a portable heating unit, two 100-pound tanks of oxygen) from the wreckage. Everyone sees the same list of items. The survivors now need to carry the most important items on a 200-mile trek to get to "home base."

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to rank all 15 items in the order of most important to least important for survival, as the astronauts travel from the wrecked spaceship to home base. For example, if the oxygen tanks are the most important for survival, then they would receive the rank of 1. If the 50-foot rope is the least important for survival, then it gets the rank of 15.

Participants' rankings are evaluated based on how close their rankings are to those created by a panel of experts from NASA. That is, the expert ranking is the "true" answer, and the closer a participant is to the true answer, the more points they earn. The highest possible score is achieved when participants rank all 15 items in the exact same order as the experts did.

If working in a team, participants are able to discuss the scenario with each other and come up with a single set of rankings as a team.
