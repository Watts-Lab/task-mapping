# Recall images

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a certain number of images to memorize on individual screens.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to memorize all target images within a fixed amount of time so that one can recall them in later tasks. For example, participants can be given 20 seconds to memorize six target faces and then asked to identify those target faces on presented in consecutive rounds 15 sets that consist of three faces each.

Participants are evaluated on the number of correctly recalled images. The maximum score occurs when participants recall all images correctly during tasks that follow after the memorization period and the score is maximized by recalling correctly as many images as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Working memory, visual memory.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
See the target images for a limited amount of time, see the sets of images and click on the target images to respond, use a communication mechanism (e.g. chat) between group members to discuss strategies in the group communcation version of the experiment.

### Other Allowed Processes
During the memorization period, participants could change the visual stimuli at any time by using the change button in the top left of their screen.
