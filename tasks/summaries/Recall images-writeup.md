# Recall images

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a certain number of images to memorize on individual screens.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to memorize all target images within a fixed amount of time and to be able to identify them later from a lineup of old and new images.

For example, participants can be given 20 seconds to memorize six target faces and then asked to identify those target faces at a later time. At the later time period, they could be consecutively shown 15 sets of three faces (6 previously seen, and 39 new), and asked to pick out which faces were the images that they had previously seen before.

Participants are evaluated on the number of correctly recalled images. They earn the maximum score when they recall all images correctly (e.g., select the 6 original faces out of 45). This means they need to correctly identify all the images that they had seen before, and avoid mis-identifying a new image as something they had previously seen.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Working memory, visual memory.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
See the target images for a limited amount of time, see the sets of images and click on the target images to respond, use a communication mechanism (e.g. chat) between group members to discuss strategies in the group communcation version of the experiment.

### Other Allowed Processes
During the memorization period, participants could change the visual stimuli at any time by using the change button in the top left of their screen.
