# Categorization problem

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive 16 cards with two objects on each one. Half of the objects on cards can be grouped into four categories. That is, for example, there can be categories like "vehicles," "animals," "furniture" and "shapes" that include four objects each. Participants see all objects depicted on cards in a mixed random order. Only one object on each card is used in category formation while most other objects are distractor pairs that are meant to complicate the task and that participants have to avoid, using the second object in the card instead to form a category. For example, a category of furniture can contain armchair, bar stool, office chair and hanger, while alarm clock and wall clack would be a distractor pair and other objects on these cards should be used to form categories.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to form four groups of items with no cards left unused wihtin a fixed amount of time. The task is designed in such a way that four categories cannot be formed if participants start using distractor pairs because there is only one objective way of forming categories so that all cards are used. Participants either complete a task by forming four objectively coherent categories or not.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Problem solving, categorization, teamwork.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Ask for instructions and clarifications; in first training session: see each others' cards, ask questions and get feedback on correct categories; in second training session: see other participants, exchange cards freely, describe cards to other participants; experimental tasks: use all 16 cards; fill out post-task questionnaire.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
