# Bullard Houses

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned randomly in one of three formats: one-on-one, two-on-two, and three-on-three. All teams are given a counterpart of equal size. One side serves as the seller(s)  on behalf of a retail company representing the Bullard Family. The other acts as an agent representing a blind trust company operated by a hotel group. The seller is instructed to only sell the property to a known buyer who fully discloses their planned use of the property, while also seeking to get a fair deal for the family. The buyer is instructed to keep the buyer's identity hidden and not reveal the intended use of the site while also trying to reach a fair deal for the property. Both parties are to attempt to reach an agreement while acting in their roles. After negotiations cease, participants should report whether they have reached an agreement or an impasse. These should be coded, i.e. agreement(0) and impasse (1).

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants should report whether the negotiation is settled or not. This requires careful analysis of the available information both before and during the negotiation. Beforehand, negotiators should work through a variety of simplified, but reasonably realistic financial structures (bonds, mortgages, loans, etc.) to make a judgment about the relative worth of the various offers and possible alternatives. During the negotiations, while much information cannot be revealed, what can have important, probably unforeseen, but not obvious implications for the other side. In this game, the best outcome of a negotiation is to avoid reaching an agreement.
