# Architectural design task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive written and video instructions of a task to design a house, a garage, and a pool in a computer program. Within the program, they have a limited number of building blocks of different color and size to use. For example, participants can view a table of available materials, in which they can see twenty-seven 1x1 red blocks, twelve 2x4 blue blocks, zero 1x6 orange blocks, etc. 

Participants receive scoring information for each object. For example, participants can see that each square foot used to build a pool will bring them a $50 bonus and that following certain design restrictions (e.g., using certain colors for the pool and making it symmetric) will give them a $1500 bonus. Participants also receive rules to follow for building objects. For example, a pool must include a diving board and have blue floors.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to design a house, a garage, and a pool of as high value as possible. Three objects must be designed from a limited set of building blocks within a fixed amount of time. The task can only be considered completed if participants adhere to the provided rules for each building. If participants don't follow the building rules, their design project fails.

In other words, participants have to maximize the value of objects they are designing but they have to do so in a specific way, balancing tradeoffs of following the building rules and adding value to each object. Within these restrictions, however, they are free to be creative and produce any design they wish.

### Skills
