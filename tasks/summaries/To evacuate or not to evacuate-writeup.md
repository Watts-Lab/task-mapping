# To evacuate or not to evacuate

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants read about a situation in which 'a disaster may or may not strike.' They are given information about the risk level of the disaster, as well as a button to "evacuate" from the disaster. 

Evacuating from the disaster costs money --- participants lose half their bonus if they choose to evacuate. However, if they don't evacuate and the disaster happens, then they lose their entire bonus. Therefore, this task is about weighing up the different risks and rewards of clicking the "evacuate" button.

Participants only find out whether the disaster happened or not at the very end of the game. All participants are equally affected by the disaster, but they make their selection for evacuation individually.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to make a decision regarding whether or not to evacuate.

Choosing NOT to evacuate means that there is high risk (you could get nothing), but potential for a high reward. On the other hand, choosing to evacuate has a low risk but a smaller reward.
