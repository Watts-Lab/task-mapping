# Splitting a deck of cards

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are shown cards one-by-one, with the fist card card shown being an example of a rule diving the deck of 52 cards into categories -- cards that adhere to the rule (exemplars) and cards that don't (non-exemplars).

From the instructions, participants know that the rule can be based on numerical value of cards; their color, suit, logical connectives, alternation, or any combination of these. For example, rules can be that exemplars are divisible by 3 or that two black and one red cards alternate.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to induce the rule dividing the deck of cards in as few trials as possible within  a fixed amount of time.

As participant keep seeing new cards one-by-one, they make proposals as to what the rule is and receive immediate feedback. Cards that have been shown get sorted into exemplars and non-exemplars and stay in front of participants so that they can see patterns. To get a better score on the task, participants have to understand what the pattern is as fast as they can.
