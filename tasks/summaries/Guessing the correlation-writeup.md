# Guessing the correlation

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants received a series of scatter plots (a series of points plotted on a grid).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to estimate the correlation of the points on the grid. (For example, if all the dots are in a straight line pointing upwards, the correlation is 1; if the dots are completely scattered randomly with no pattern at all, the correlation is 0).

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Visual intelligence, intuition, communication (in some tasks)

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
View the grid, submit an independent guess, submit a final group guess, view performance feedback, revise which peers to follow in subsequent groups

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
