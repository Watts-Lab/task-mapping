# Guessing the correlation

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a series of scatter plots which are a series of points plotted on a grid. In any round, all participants see plots with an identical correlation.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to estimate the correlation of the points on the grid. (For example, if all the dots are in a straight line pointing upwards, the correlation is 1; if the dots are completely scattered randomly with no pattern at all, the correlation is 0). There is no time limit to make an estimation.

Participants are evaluated on the accuracy of their judgment. They receive the highest score by guessing the exact correlation but they have to try to get as many points as possible by being as precise as they can. After participants sumbit their guess, they can see the true correlation and see whether they are right or wrong as well as how close their guess is to the true correlation.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Visual intelligence, intuition, communication (in some tasks)

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Viewing the grid, submitting an independent guess, submitting a final group guess, viewing performance feedback, revising which peers to follow in subsequent groups.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
