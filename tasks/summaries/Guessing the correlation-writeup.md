# Guessing the correlation

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Randomized groups of 12 were assigned to one of three treatment conditions with varying network plasticity in the first 10 tasks and varying quality of feedback in the last 10 tasks, which allowed to identify the role of dynamic networks and feedback in fostering adaptive ‘wisdom of crowds.’

## 2. Goal Directives 
Estimate the correlation of a scatter plots in a sequence of 20 tasks.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Visual intelligence, intuition, communication (in some tasks)

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
View the grid, submit an independent guess, submit a final group guess, view performance feedback, revise which peers to follow in subsequent groups

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
