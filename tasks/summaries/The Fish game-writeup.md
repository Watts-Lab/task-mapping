# The Fish game

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
A game board where the player can move his avatar and see the corresponding scores to the current location (the avatar is at)

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to move the avatar to achieve the highest score.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical skill

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants could see the scores at their avatars' locations but they could not see the scores that other players were obtaining or the scores at any other locations. They could see the positions, directions, and speeds of all other players. Participants can control their avatar using the left and right arrow keys to turn (at a rate of 40◦ per second) and can hold the spacebar to accelerate. If the avatars are close to a wall the displayed score will change from a dashed line to a red “0%”.

### Other Allowed Processes
The game scores of the participants were determined by underlying “score fields”. These score fields consisted of 480 ×285 arrays of score values for each 125ms time interval in the game.
