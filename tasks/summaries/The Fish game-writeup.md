# The Fish game

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 

The participants see a shared virtual canvas with many different cursors moving around. Each participant controls their own cursor (which is denoted by a unique color and the word "YOU"). Participants are able to use the controls to move their cursor and "walk" around the virtual space.

An underlying system sets a "point value" for each location in the space. That is, walking to specific locations in the virtual space will earn the participant more points. Participants will be able to see how many points their current location gives them, and they will also see the running total of how many points they earned so far. However, participants do not know where the high-point-earning locations are, so they must wander around the virtual room. Participants lose all their points if they touch the wall.

## 2. Goal Directives 

The goal is to maximize points in the game by discovering and moving your cursor to the highest point-earning locations in the virtual space. Participants try to get as many points as possible before the time limit expires.

This essentially involves a bit of trial and error, since participants only see how many points their current location is worth. There is also an element of understanding risks and tradeoffs: participants have to decide whether to explore other locations in the room (at the risk of only finding lower-point areas) or just stay put and earn however many points their current location is worth (at the risk of not finding the highest point-earning location). When playing with others, participants may get a sense of where to go by observing where other people in the room are heading.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical skill

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants could see the scores at their avatars' locations but they could not see the scores that other players were obtaining or the scores at any other locations. They could see the positions, directions, and speeds of all other players. Participants can control their avatar using the left and right arrow keys to turn (at a rate of 40◦ per second) and can hold the spacebar to accelerate. If the avatars are close to a wall the displayed score will change from a dashed line to a red “0%”.

### Other Allowed Processes
The game scores of the participants were determined by underlying “score fields”. These score fields consisted of 480 ×285 arrays of score values for each 125ms time interval in the game.
