# Apache helicopter flight simulator (Longbow2)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to groups of three to play the Apache helicopter flight simulator game called Longbow2. Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the pilot (person flying the aircraft), the gunner (person operating the weapons system), or the radar specialist (person monitoring and interpreting radar systems containing critical enemy information). Participants are given a limited amount of time to complete various tasks (e.g. destroying enemy tanks) and stay alive. Before performing the task, they would receive training in role-specific task skills.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to maximize the score of the team. The score is calculated from the sum of the number of targets acquired during the course of each mission and the team’s average “alive time”. Team performance scores could range from 0 (no targets killed, helicopter killed by enemies immediately) to 30 (killed 15 targets, stayed alive for the duration of the 15-minute mission).
