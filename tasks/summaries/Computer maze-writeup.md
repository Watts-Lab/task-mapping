# Computer maze

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants were given a computer monitor with a virtual maze environment and either a keyboard or a joystick.


## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to tag as many identical "greeble" pairs in the computer-based maze as possible out of six identical and six distracting greebles.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Spatial visualisation, object visualization

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Complete a pre-screening, view task instructions, navigate two small practice mazes during practice period, view feedback during practice period, navigate maze 1 in a virtual maze environment, freely discuss task in pairs between maze 1 and maze 2, navigate maze 2, tag a greeble pair with either keyboard or joystick.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants were assigned either a "navigator" role or a "tagger" role. In the diverse condition, the individual high in spatial visualization was given the role of the navigator, and the individual high in object visualization was assigned the role of a tagger. In the homogeneous conditions, these roles were randomly assigned.
