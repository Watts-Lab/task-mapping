# Sudoku

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see a shared online system that displays a Sudoku puzzle. 

Sudoku is a logic puzzle, in which there is a 9x9 grid, which is divided into nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as "boxes" or "regions"). Each cell in a region has a true underlying value from 1-9; however, most of the cells appear empty to the player, and only a few of them have the correct numbers filled in.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to solve the Sudoku puzzle within a limited amount of time. This means that participants need to fill in each blank cell with the correct underlying number from 1-9; in addition, they must satisfy the constraint that every row, every column, and every 3x3 region can only show each digit from 1-9 exactly once.

For a given Sudoku puzzle, there is only one correct answer. Participants either correctly identify the underlying value for every cell, or they fail the Sudoku game.

Finally, participants working in groups may use a chat function to discuss which value should be placed in a given cell.
