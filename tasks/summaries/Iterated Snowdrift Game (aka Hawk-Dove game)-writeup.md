# Iterated Snowdrift Game (aka Hawk-Dove game)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired in a group acting as two drivers who are caught in a blizzard and trapped on either side of a snowdrift. They can either get out and start shoveling (cooperate) or remain in the car (defect).

If both cooperate, they have the benefit of getting home while sharing the labor. Thus, Rewards = benefit - labour / 2. If both defect, they do not get anywhere and hence incur the punishment, meaning the Rewards = 0. If only one shovels, however, they both get home but the defector avoids the labor cost and gets all the benefits (Rewards = benefit), whereas the cooperator gets fewer Rewards, which is equal to benefit - label. We assume benefit is greater than labour.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize their (individual) payoff and are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to make a decision. Letting the opponent do all the work is the best option but if the other player stays in the car it is better to shovel. For example, there are three groups in the game. In Group 1, both player A and player B decide to cooperate. In Group 2, player C remains in the car while player D gets out and starts shoveling. In Group 3, neither player E nor player F is willing to cooperate. The payoff values of different players rank in order: player C > player A/player B > player D > player E/player F.
