# Search for Oil Task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Pariticipants view a shared 12x12 grid of points, creating a digital "map". Each point represents a section of "land" in a theoretical oil field. A limited number of these points have been pre-determined by the makers of the game to contain "oil," while others contain nothing. 

Participants are also given some information about which points might be more likely (but not certain!) to contain the oil. For example, they are told that some parts of this grid represent land with the appropriate chemical composition, making it more probable that there will be oil there. (Other pieces of information that make oil more or less likely include information about the surface hardness, surface mantle thickness, and geological stratification of the area.)

After being shown the detailed information for a limited amount of time, participants have to remember as much information as they can and then decide where they want to "drill" completely from memory. During the main gameplay, participants see just the 12x12 map, where they are able to click on each point if they want to drill there.

As participants select which locations they want to drill, they are given feedback after each decision. For example, after participants pick a point on the 12x12 grid to drill oil, they will be told whether they were right or wrong about oil being there, and they will see the running total of their score.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the task is to decide which of the 144 sections of land is suitable for drilling oil, and to do so as accurately as possible before the game's time limit runs out. In other words, participants have to remember and account for all the information they were provided about where oil is most likely to be found, and then decide where they want to "drill" (by clicking on the point on the map).

Participants aim to get the highest possible score, and they earn points for every location with oil that they successfully find. They lose points if they select locations that do not have oil. Therefore, one would get the maximum score of this game by correctly finding every point with oil without making any mistakes.
