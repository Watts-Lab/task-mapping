# Blocks World for Teams

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to a group of four and work together to complete a search-and-deliver task. There are nine rooms, designated A1 through C3, with each room containing colored blocks. A 10th room, designated the “drop zone,” is located at the bottom of the map. Participants are tasked with delivering specified colored blocks to the drop zone. The sequence of colored blocks to retrieve during each task was depicted below the drop zone. In addition to the 10 rooms, there are hallways allowing participants to travel from room to room. Each participant has a BOT, and can move the BOT to pick up a block. To pick up a block, a participant can enter a room using his or her BOT and type the first letter of the block color (e.g., “b” for a blue block or “r” for a red block). The participant then enters the drop zone and types the letter “d” to successfully deliver the block. If the participant delivers a block into the drop zone that is not of the requested color, this incorrect block would be automatically and randomly placed into one of the other nine rooms.

Several constraints are imposed in order to limit the visual range of each participant. Each participant could only see the blocks in the room he or she was currently occupying, including the drop zone. Participants are also unable to see the locations of their teammates; however, each room contains a door that provides information as to whether adjacent rooms are occupied: When another agent is occupying an adjacent room, the door to that room is colored red; otherwise, it is colored green.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to search for and deliver a specified series of colored blocks as quickly as possible. They should complete the task within a limited amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
communication skills, coordination skills, analytical skills, reasoning skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
To move a BOT, a participant can right-click anywhere in the environment (i.e., rooms or hallways) and then select “go here” from a menu of options that subsequently appeared. To pick up a block, a participant can enter a room using his or her BOT and typed the first letter of the block color (e.g., “b” for a blue block or “r” for a red block). The participant then enters the drop zone and types the letter “d” to successfully deliver the block.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants are able to communicate with all of their teammates simultaneously or with individual team members using the communications available to them in the interface. For example, when participants click on communication, a dropdown menu is available to them to send the message to a specific participant (“BOT1,” “BOT2,” “BOT3,” and “BOT4”) or “Everyone” to broadcast the message globally. When participants click on a communication message that has a bolded item (e.g., “ROOM,” “BLOCK”), a multilevel drop-down menu appeared. This allows participants to first select the participant to whom they want to send the message, then room or block identification information.
