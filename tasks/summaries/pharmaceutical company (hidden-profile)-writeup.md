## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to triads and participate in a role-playing simulation of managers in a pharmaceutical company trying to decide which of two drugs to market. They would be given information sheets about the drugs and be given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to familiarize themselves with the information. However, the information sheets are constructed such that some of the facts were shared (provided to all three members) and some were unshared (provided to only one group member). They would be also told that the company is in financial trouble and that their marketing decision is therefore especially important. After they finish reading the information sheets individually, they would be asked to recall as many of the facts about each drug as they could and be given limited time for the recall task. Following the recall task, the group would be asked to discuss the problem and come to a group consensus about which drug to market.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for each group is to reach an agreement on the drug they would like to market. The task is designed so that the full information would show that one drug of the two is the best. They should find out the optimal drug within the time limit.
