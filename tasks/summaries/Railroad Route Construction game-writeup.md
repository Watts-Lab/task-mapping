Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
A game to create train track routes by moving the railroad pieces to the right positions

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the task is to test whether the robotâ€™s vulnerability would help to ease group tension and facilitate positive group dynamics.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
visual imagination, cognitive skills, problem solving skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
The participants are shown a board with a bank of railroad pieces on the left side of the screen. As participants placed pieces on the board, a piece from the bank of pieces will be greyed out so that piece could no longer be selected. Display at the end of each round whether the group as a whole succeeded or failed. Utterances in the neutral and vulnerable conditions are shown on the screen as if they were spoken by the robot after each player have completed their track and the overall score is shown

### Other Allowed Processes
The task was preprogrammed to win or lose a certain set of rounds. On rounds programmed to lose, the final necessary piece of track was not available to the human during that round.
