# Writing story

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants received a writing prompt. Examples include, "Write a story about this inkblot," or "Describe this mountain scene." Everyone in the same team gets the same writing prompt.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to write a response to the prompt. If working in teams, participants discuss and collectively produce the same story. The work must be submitted online within a fixed time period.

Since this is an open-ended writing task, there are no right or wrong answers, and anything that addresses the writing prompt is a valid answer. Participants are evaluated based on the quality of their responses (for example, the length, writing quality, and level of creativity).

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Writing, group work

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Receive instructions, work on the task in groups within the time limit, submit a response

### Other Allowed Processes
An example of a task which is fairly typical of the set (although particularly brief) is:"What makes for success in our culture? Write a paragraph or two summarizing your opinions as a group on this question."
