# Biopharm Seltek

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired for a negotiation about the sale of a biotechnology plant. Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the buyer, CFO of BioPharm and the seller, CFO of Selteck. BioPharm needs to buy or build a plant to produce a genetically engineered (“biotech”) antibiotic compound, Depox. Depox is a promising pharmaceutical product and BioPharm needs a plant with special manufacturing equipment. There are two choices for BioPharm: (1) build a new plant; (2) buy a plant that is already set up to manufacture genetically engineered compounds and Selteck seems like an ideal “turnkey” facility. BioPharm possesses public information about Seltek, including previous appraisal value, accounting statements, and so on.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants playing the role of BioPharm should reach a concensus with their counterparts. Alternatively, they could decide to build a new plant instead of buying the plant from Selteck.
