## 1. Stimulus Complex 
A mapping where the 10 letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, were each randomly assigned without replacement to one of the 10 numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

## 2. Goal Directives 
The objective was to identify the mapping of the 10 letters to the 10 numbers in as few trials as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Math, logical reasoning, teamwork, collaboration

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
communicate with every group member, type in equations, receive feedback on the screen, submit the full correct coding

### Other Allowed Processes
The explanation for the second image attached below: On the first trial the person chooses the equation A + B= and the experimenter tells the person that the solution to this equation is C. This is because A=3 and B=5, which sums to 8, the letter represented by C. The person then guesses that A represents the number 1 and the experimenter indicates that this is not the case, or False. On the second trial, the person asks the solution to the equation B + C= and is told that the answer is EA. This is because B=5 and C=8, which sums to 13 or EA.
