# Summarize Discussion

Mapped by: sarikasu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
For this task, participants are given an open-ended discussion statement about a specific topic. The statement may be a question like, "what makes for success in our culture?" or "should birth control be made available to anyone without a prescription?" Everyone in the same team gets the same question.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are asked to talk about and submit a response to the discussion statement --- that is, they need to turn in a written summary of their arguments or answers to the question given to them. (For example, "Yes, birth control should be made available to anyone for three reasons, Number 1..." or "No, we should not make birth control available to everyone. You should need a prescription because ...") If people disagree, the summary needs to resolve and synthesize the pros and cons.

Participants have a specific time limit for completing the writeup. They are graded on the quality of their final written summary.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
critical thinking, creative thinking, listening skills, reasoning skills, comprehension skills (ability to summarize key points)

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
A group chat interface for discussion and a text box for submitting responses to the statement. In some versions of the experiment, participants could jointly edit their response (just like in a Google Doc). Alternatively, each person could subit a separate writeup. (Optional) Video chat.

### Other Allowed Processes
The amount of time given for discussion could change.
