# Wildcam Gorongosa (Zooniverse)

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get to view a series of pictures of animals taken by motion-detecting cameras in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. Participants view and interact with the pictures through an online interface on the Wildcam Gorongosa site.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to classify as many pictures as correctly as possible according to five criteria within a fixed amount of time. For each picture, participants are tasked with:

(1) detecting the presence of the animal(s), (2) identifying the species type, (3) counting how many animals there are, (4) identifying the behaviors exhibited, specifically, identifying whether the animal(s) is (a) standing, (b) resting, (c) moving, (d) eating, or (e) interacting (multiple behaviors may be selected), and (5) recognizing whether any young are present.

Participants are evaluated based on the total number of pictures they classified out of all possible pictures in the task and the number of correct classifications out of all classifications participants managed to do. In other words, participants maximize their score by classifying as many pictures as correctly as they can.
