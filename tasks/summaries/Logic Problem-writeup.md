# Logic Problem

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a logic problem, which is a story problem with a correct answer that must be deduced via logic. This problem is shared among everyone who is working together.

Here is an example question: There are five couples who vacationed at five different ski resorts. Based on the clues, figure out which couple vacationed where. Participants would get a set of clues to solve this problem, such as "Neither Tammy nor Sue vacationed in Innsbruck," "Both Rita and Mrs. Owens returned from their vacations with broken wrists," "no one at Tahoe was injured that weekend," and so on. Participants are provided with sufficient clues to be able to solve the question.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to use the clues provided to achieve the correct answer in the logic problem. Participants must solve the problem and submit their answer within a limited amount of time.

In the above example, the participants would use logic to reason that neither Rita nor Mrs. Owens went to Tahoe, since no one at Tahoe was injured. They would then use other clues to match the correct people to the correct vacation locations.

Participants are scored based on the number of correct matches in the final solution that they get. In this case, since there are five couples and and five ski resorts, participants would get credit for every pair that they are able to match, and they would achieve the maximum score if they get all five pairs correct.
