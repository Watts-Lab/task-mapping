## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a shared online spreadsheet tool that can be edited, as well as a shared, static copy of a spreadsheet with each cell colored in a different way (the "target" spreadsheet).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to reproduce the "target" spreadsheet in the editable spreadsheet. That is, within a fixed amount of time, participants have to make the shared, editable spreadsheet look like an exact copy of the pattern of colors in the "target" spreadsheet.

Participants receive points for coloring a cell correctly and don't receive points for coloring a cell incorrectlly. They get the maximum score on the task if they reproduce the exact copy of the "target" spreadsheet and they try to get the highest score by correctly coloring as many cells as they can.
