# Graph coloring task

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Six graph coloring problems (six different topology/network graphs)

## 2. Goal Directives 
Use the colors given to color the entire network without conflicts (edges connecting two vertices with the same color)

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
coordination (without communication), understanding of the chromatic number of a network

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
coordination (without communication), understanding of the chromatic number of a network

### Other Allowed Processes
Subjects could update their colors at any time from a menu that included the fixed minimum of colors needed to solve the problem and were given different neighbor views from low view (solely subject colors and their neighbors colors), medium view (neighbors colors and labeled and number of links are visible) and high information view (entire network colors visible)
