# Graph coloring task

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given one or more "graph coloring problems". These are pictures of different topology/network graphs. 

For context, these look like many different nodes (points), which are connected by various edges. Imagine, for example, a picture of a social network: each person in the network is a "node," and each of their friends is an "edge."

In this case, all participants have access to and can interact with a shared graph. Participants will also be given a limited set of colors, with a sufficient number of colors to complete the task successfully.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to use the colors given to "color" the entire network without conflicts. This means that participants need to assign each node in the graph a color, ensuring that no two connected nodes share the same color. Using our social network example, if Person A and Person B are friends (which means they are connected), they cannot be assigned the same color. Participants must successfully color all nodes and resolve all conflicts within a specified amount of time, or receive no credit.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
coordination (without communication), understanding of the chromatic number of a network

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants should be able to see the networks, see the real-time coloring progress, see the colors given and choose the color, and color the assigned vertex (by clicking on the nodes in the graph to assign them a color).

### Other Allowed Processes
Subjects could update their colors at any time from a menu that included the fixed minimum of colors needed to solve the problem and were given different neighbor views from low view (solely subject colors and their neighbors colors), medium view (neighbors colors and labeled and number of links are visible) and high information view (entire network colors visible)
