# Letters-to-numbers problems (cryptography)

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given instructions to map letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J, which have been initially randomly assigned without replacement, to one of the 10 digits (0 through 9). For example, because letter "A" maps onto digit "3" and letter "B" maps onto digit "5", an opearation "A + B" would correspond to "3 + 5". If letter "C" would map onto digit "8", then A + B = C.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to identify the mapping of the 10 letters to the 10 numbers in as few trials as possible within a fixed amount of time and limited number of trials. There is a specific process participants have to follow to map letters onto numbers. Participants are first asked to come up with addition or subtraction operation (e.g., "A + B") and then given an answer in the letter form (e.g., "A + B = C"). Then participants propose a mapping for a letter (e.g., "A = 3") and receive feedback (e.g., "True, A = 3"). Participants have to follow this process in proposing the mapping of all letters to all digits. To submit their final answer, participants have to indicate to which digits all of the letters correspond.

Participants are evaluated based on several criteria, such as the number of trials they used, letters identified per trial, and letters used per equation. The maximum score is theoretical and participants maximize their score by finding the correct mapping as fast as they can.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Logical reasoning

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Communicate with every group member via chat, type in equations, receive feedback on the screen (e.g., get the solutions to the equations), and submit the full correct coding.

### Other Allowed Processes
In one version of this task, individuals could guess alone; alternatively, they could discuss their answers (via chat) with other teammates and be required to submit a single guess.
