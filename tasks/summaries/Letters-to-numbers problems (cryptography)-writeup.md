# Letters-to-numbers problems (cryptography)

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a series of mathematical problems (for example, 3+5), except the numbers have been replaced with letters! So, instead of 3+5, users would instead see "A+B", where the letter "A" maps to "3" and "B" maps to "5".

Paricipants will also have the opportunity to see the answers to certain problems. For example, 3+5 = 8; maybe the number "8" maps to the letter "C." In the case, the participant would have the information that A + B = C.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The objective was to identify the mapping of the 10 letters to the 10 numbers in as few trials as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Math, logical reasoning

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Communicate with every group member via chat, type in equations, receive feedback on the screen (e.g., get the solutions to the equations), and submit the full correct coding.

### Other Allowed Processes
In one version of this task, individuals could guess alone; alternatively, they could discuss their answers (via chat) with other teammates and be required to submit a single guess.
