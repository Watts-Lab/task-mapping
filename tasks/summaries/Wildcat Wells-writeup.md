# Wildcat Wells

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see a realistic-looking 2D desert map with dots on it that represent hidden oil fields. All dots look the same to participants but some wells are wider and deeper than others and have more oil.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to drill as many oil as possible by choosing the corresponding dots within a fixed amount of time. Participants earn points proportional to the amount of oil they discover and they maximize their tradeoff by drilling wells with the most oil.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Understanding of the score diagram, prediction based on group performance

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Navigating the virtual map of the oil field; selecting and submitting a location on a 100 × 100 grid squares as the next location to “drill” by entering coordinates or pressing on the dot; hovering over one of the drill locations (to see the current score), hovering over a bar in the history (to show the points and the corresponding location on the landscape).

### Other Allowed Processes
The total number of points the players have accumulated is always displayed to them. At the end of the rounds, players are shown a summary of the game as well as the total number of points they earned before advancing to the next game.
