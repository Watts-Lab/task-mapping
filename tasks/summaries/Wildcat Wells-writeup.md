Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the game is to "drill for oil". Participants earn points by searching for the hidden oil fields, with the goal of finding the most oil.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Understanding of the score diagram, prediction based on group performance

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Navigating the virtual map of the oil field; selecting and submitting a location on a 100 × 100 grid squares as the next location to “drill”; hovering over one of the drill locations (to see the current score), hovering over a bar in the history (to show the points and the corresponding location on the landscape).

### Other Allowed Processes
The total number of points the players have accumulated is always displayed to them. At the end of the rounds, players are shown a summary of the game as well as the total number of points they earned before advancing to the next game.
