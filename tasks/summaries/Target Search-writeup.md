# Target Search

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants view a labeled spreadsheet with 100 squares on it. The columns are given letters and the rows are given numbers (so, each blank cell has a letter-number coordinate, like A5, E10, etc.).

While these cells on the spreadsheet appear blank to the participant, each one is actually connected behind the scenes to a specific value that only the experimenter can see. On the experimenter's side, there is essentially an invisible "target" --- the cells are grouped into concentric circles. This "target" shape determines the point value of each cell. Cells located in the middle of the target are worth more points than cells near the edges of the target. The closer to the center of the target a cell is, the more points it is worth. If a cell is outside of the target entirely, it is worth 0 points.

For example, imagine that E10 is the center of the target. Then E10 is worth the most points. A cell that is next to the target (E11) is worth the second-most number of points, whereas a cell that is far away from the target (e.g., A5) would be worth fewer points (or zero, if it is outside the target).

Of course, since the participants do not see the target, they have no idea how many points each cell is worth.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to get the most points. In other words, participants need to find the coordinates of as many high-value cells as they can within a fixed amount of time and under a limited number of allowed guesses.

For each guess, participants submit the coordinate of a blank cell (e.g., A5) and then get feedback about how many points they received. Based on feedback, they would try to figure out where the the experimenter's underlying "target" is and look for the high-scoring cells. 

After a few guesses, participants can often "decipher" the logic of the sheet and will then be able to name the cells corresponding to the largest values. This is why this game is called "target search" --- participants are using each guess to learn about where the target is, and to search for the highest-value cells.

Participants are evaluated based on the values of the cells they name. The score is maximized by naming as many cells with as large values as possible. Theoretically, it is possible to find the center of the target on your first try and then only name the highest-value cells, but this is not likely to happen; most participants will experience some trial and error. If they are working in teams, participants work together to determine their next guess.
