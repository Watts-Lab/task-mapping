## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants view a labeled sheet with 100 squares which appear as blank to them but correspond to values on the same sheet with filled values which only the experimenter can see. Experimenter's sheet is a diagram that is divided into several circles by circular lines drawn on it randomly. That is, the experimener has a sheet with values divided into groups, while participants can only see the completely blank version of this sheet and coordinates for each blank cell (e.g., A-5, E-10, etc.). 

Values on the sheet are not distributed randomly but according to groupings created by lines. Experimenter decides on the "logic" as to which values should be used for each group. For example, coordinates outisde the outtermost, or the largest, circle can be equal to 0 but increase by 1 in circles that are closer to the center of the diagram.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goals is to name as many coordinates of cells from the sheet with as large values as possible within a fixed amount of time and under a limited number of trials. As their guesses, participants only sumbit coorindates of blank cells (e.g., A-5) and then receive feedback about how many scores they earn according to the experimenter's diagram after each decision. That is, participants can theoretically "decipher" the logic of the sheet after a few tries and then only try to name the cells which correspond to the largest values.

Participants are evaluated based on the values of the cells they name. The score is maximized by naming as many cells with as large values as possible.
