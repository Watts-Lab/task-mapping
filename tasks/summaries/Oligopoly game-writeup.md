# Oligopoly game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants first read the instruction before the game. The game has 6 rounds, in which participants will decide whether to "compete" or "collude." All decisions must go up at the count of "THREE." Players would get a different number of payoffs in each round based on their own decision as well as the decision of their "rivals" which are determined by the majority of all votes in the group.

Suppose the four possible pay-offs are as follows (the first element represents the decision made by you, the second stands for rivals’ decision and the third is the pay-off): ["Compete", "Compete", 10], ["Collude", "Compete", 0], ["Compete", "Collude", 40], ["Collude", "Collude", 20]. In the first round, more than half of the players decide to "compete." Then those who choose to "compete" would receive 10 points. Those who choose to "collude” would receive 0 points. Then we will play round 2 and everyone will vote all over again. Suppose in round 2 a majority of players choose to "collude". Then those who choose to “compete” receive 40 points and those who "collude" receive 20 points.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize the total pay-offs.
