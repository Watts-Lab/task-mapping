# Arithmetic problem 2

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
All group members receive different clues and have to collaborate to reach a solution to an arithmetic problem. The problem involves figuring out what time a plane arrives at its final destination given the set of clues. No one of the participants can solve the problem alone as no one has all the information needed to solve it. The clue is randomly distributed among group members and involves essential information such as plane stopover time, the distance between the source and destination, and the speed of the plane.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to solve the problem in the shortest possible time. In order to do so, they should communicate with each other about their clues in order to reach solutions. They must give an answer within the time limit.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.
