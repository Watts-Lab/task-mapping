## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get a series of pegs, or points, of different colors to use in a logic game played on computer. For example, participants can get 6 colors to use during the game: blue, red, green, orange, yellow, and purple.

As game begins, an algorithm randomly designates a color pattern as a correct answer to  the game. For example, a correct pattern to the game can consist of 4 colors: yellow, orange, yellow, red.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to identify as many colors and their places from the correct pattern in as few trials as possible within a fixed amount of time.

As the game begins, participants have a limited number of trials to propose color patterns. Participants receive immediate feedback in the form of black and white pegs after each trial regarding how many colors (white peg) and both colors and their positions (black peg) they got right. For example, if the correct pattern includes yellow, orange, yellow, red, and a participant proposes blue, green, orange, red, then this participants correctly identifies two colors from the pattern and a position of one of them correctly and, therefore, receives a white peg for orange and a black peg for red. Participants don't know from the feedback exactly which color and position they identified correctly but they have to try to deduce it from feedback for each trial.

In other words, the score is maximized by receiving as many pegs, especially black ones, as early in the game as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
