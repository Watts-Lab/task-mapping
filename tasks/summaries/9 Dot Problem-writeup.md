# 9 Dot Problem

Mapped by: sarikasu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a 3x3 grid of nine dots, which is shared by everyone completing the task.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Within a limited amount of time, participants must connect all nine dots (e.g., draw a line that passes through them) using no more than four lines, and may not retrace any lines.

Participants will be able to visually tell that they have successfully met these criteria. They are given full credit if they accomplish this task, and no credit if they fail.

An important note is that there is really only one "correct" answer to this question --- that is, the way to connect the nine dots actually requires the participant to go "outside" the boundaries of the 3x3 grid, or else it cannot be done. The true goal of this task is to find this optimal answer. 

Participants who do not think "outside the box" therefore usually have difficulty completing this task. Once they are shown that the answer involves going outside of the box, they usually have an "aha" moment and do well on the task in the future.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical thinking, geometric reasoning

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Shared view of dot problem where people can see others moving/playing with lines on the grid, interface to click and drag to "draw" lines on the screen, chat box to allow for communication, error message when grid is not solved for

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
