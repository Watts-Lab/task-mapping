# Rank cities by population, rank words by familiarity

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a list of cities (e.g., South Bend, Little Rock, Jacksonville, Portland, Charlotte, Lowell) or a list of words (e.g., Uncle, Kennel, Effort, Money, Village).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to rank cities by population according to the recent populating census and words by familiarity to people in participants' country within a fixed amount of time as correctly and accurately as possible. The rank of 1 is given to the city with the largest population or to the most common word, the rank of 2 is given to the second largest city or most familiar words, and so on.

Participants are evaluated based on how correct their ranking is compared to either population census or the data on familiarity with certain words within a nation. The maximum score is achieved if the ranking is fully correct and the score is maximized by assigning as many correct rank values as possible.
