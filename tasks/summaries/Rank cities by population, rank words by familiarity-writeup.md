# Rank cities by population, rank words by familiarity

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive a list of cities (e.g., South Bend, Little Rock, Jacksonville, Portland, Charlotte, Lowell) or a list of words (e.g., Uncle, Kennel, Effort, Money, Village).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to rank the cities by their population according to the most recent population census, and to rank the words by familiarity to people in the participants' country. The rank of 1 is given to the city with the largest population or to the most common word, the rank of 2 is given to the second largest city or second most familiar word, and so on. Participants must do this task as correctly and accurately as possible and within a fixed amount of time.

Participants are evaluated based on how correct their ranking is compared to the "ground truth" data, which is either the population census or the data on familiarity with certain words within a nation. The maximum score is achieved if the ranking is fully correct and the score is maximized by assigning as many correct rank values as possible.
