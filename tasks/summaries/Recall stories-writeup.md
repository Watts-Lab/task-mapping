# Recall stories

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants read one or more stories that are each approximately 4 pages in length. After reading each story, they advance to a different page (where they are no longer able to reference the story), and they see multiple (e.g., 12) reading comprehension questions accompanying the story. Every question has an objectively correct answer based on the text.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to correctly answer knowledge questions about the stories within a fixed amount of time. 

Participants are evaluated on the number of correctly answered questions and they earn the maximum score when they answer all questions correctly. Since they cannot reference the stories, they must answer the questions based on their memory of what they read.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
