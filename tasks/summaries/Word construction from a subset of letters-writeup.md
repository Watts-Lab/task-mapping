# Word construction from a subset of letters

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are presented with nine letters. For example: A, F, H, B, E, J, N, K, D.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to produce as many four-letter words as possible from a given set of nine letters within a fixed amount of time. For example, out of the set of letters above, such words as "bean," "head,", "khan," "dean" and many others can be formed. Although there is a theoretical maximum score if participants exhaust all the possible combinations of letters to form four-letter words, the goal is simply to form as many words as participants can staying within a time limit.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
English fluency, vocabulary

### UI-UX Allowed Processes

### Other Allowed Processes
The subset of letters did not allow for the participants to create the target words from the Hidden figures experiment.
