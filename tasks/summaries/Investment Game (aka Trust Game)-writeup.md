# Investment Game (aka Trust Game)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are assigned to one of two rooms: Room A or Room B. They then play a two-stage game. In the first stage, participants in Room A are given some money and have to decide how much to send to participants in Room B. In the second stage, the recipients in Room B get triple the amount of money that was sent to them. They then must decide how much money to keep for themselves, and how much to send back to those in Room A.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants should maximize their own pay-off (get as much money in the end as possible). Those in Room A must balance the possible benefit of earning more money (since all the money they give to Room B is tripled) with the risk that the people in Room B would keep all the extra money for themselves, leaving those in Room A with nothing. Conversely, those in Room B must decide whether they will keep all of the money for themselves, or give a portion of it back to Room A. Participants are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to send money back and forth.
