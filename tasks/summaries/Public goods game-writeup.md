# Public goods game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants receive the same amount of tokens and they secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot. The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less than the number of players, N) and this "public good" payoff is evenly divided among players. Each participant also keeps the tokens they do not contribute.

Here is an example to help you imagine what the game might look like. A group of four players participates in this game with $20 in hand. Three players contribute their full $20 while the fourth chooses to contribute $0. The $60 is multiplied by a factor of 1.2 and the resulting $72 is distributed equally among the four players. In this scenario, the three players contributing the most get $18 while the fourth player gets as much as $38.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize their individual payoff as well as the group’s total payoff. It means that one goal is to maximize their personal earnings, which means that they should not invest anything. But another goal is to optimize the group’s outcomes, which means that everyone should contribute all of their tokens to the public pool. Participants should try to maximize both individual and group outcomes, which causes a tradeoff. They are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to play the game.
