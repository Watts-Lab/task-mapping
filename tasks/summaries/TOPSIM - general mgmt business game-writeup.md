# TOPSIM - general mgmt business game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to a team and manage a fictitious company. They compete against other teams which manage other companies in the same simulated market. Over each period (the eight weeks), teams have to develop and adapt business strategies based on the basic endowments in the different functional areas of their company and based on the economic situation in their respective market. In each period, teams have to decide on a number of variables driving company performance: the sales price(s) of the product(s), marketing and sales activities, R&D expenses, investment in environmental facilities or process optimizations, and financial resources. At the end of each period, each company’s periodic share price will be calculated based on how the company as well as its competitors decided on the above-described variables given the predetermined endowment and economic circumstances. The group then receives a full report documenting how the team performed as well as an updated economic forecast for the subsequent period in order to make new business decisions.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize the firm’s share price at the end of the eight-week period. The final share price translates into a team grade with the best possible grade going to each market’s best-performing company. The remaining companies are graded relative to the best performers. In other words, the highly competitive setting incentivizes teams not to cooperate with competitors.
