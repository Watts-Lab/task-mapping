# Allocating resources to programs

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Partipants are given a list of complex competing programs, along with details of those programs. All participants get a list with the same programs. For example, participants could receive the following list:
 
 (1.) To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.
 (2.) To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.
 (3.) To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to collectively decide how to allocate $500,000 between three competing programs in 10 minutes. As each program on this cognitive conflict task is designed to appeal to personal values, there is no rgiht, wrong, or optimal way of allocation. Therefore, performance on this task is not measured.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Communication, analytical thinking, creative thinking, decision making, negotiations

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants can discuss the different program options via a chat interface and subsequently use the interface to make their decision. Variants of the interface could have individuals submit their own private proposals, or could force the group to come to consensus and submit a single allocation of funds. 

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
