# Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a problem that reads as follows:

"Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.

The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?"

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to achieve the fewest number of trips that get the wolf, goat, and cabbage from one river bank to another, and to solve this problem within the time limit.

There are a few different possible solutions that get to the lowest number. All of the solutions require the participants take the goat over first, because any other action will lead to something being eaten. Once the farmer comes back, though, there is a dilemma, because if he takes the wolf over, the wolf would eat the goat on the other side; if he takes the cabbage over, the goat would eat the cabbage on the other side.

The "trick" to this problem is to realize that the farmer can actually take the goat BACK on his return trip: that is, he takes either the wolf or cabbage with him on the second trip. Then, he takes the goat BACK to the ORIGINAL side. He then picks up the remaining one of the cabbage or wolf, and finally, he goes back with the goat. Realizing that you can actually bring things back and forth (in both directions), rather than just in one direction across the river, usually requires some out-of-the-box thinking.

Therefore, participants must satisfy the constraints of the problem while also thinking creatively. As a final piece of helpful context, this task is actually a well-known one that many people have built algorithms to solve.

To summarize, the solution to this task is:

1. Take the goat to the other side
2. Return to original side (where the wolf and cabbage are)
3. Take either the wolf or cabbage to the other side
4. Return to the original side with the goat [THIS IS THE TRICK! Realizing this prevents either the wolf eating the goat or the goat eating the cabbage.]
5. Take the cabbage or wolf over to the other side
6. Return to the original side, where only the goat remains.
7. Take the goat over
