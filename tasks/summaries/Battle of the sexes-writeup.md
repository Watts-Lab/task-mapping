## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired with a different anonymous opponent for a series of decision-making rounds. Throughout the rounds, participants are alternatingly assigned to rows or columns and have access to a table presenting the payoff they can expect to receive for each combination of actions from them and their opponent. The participants may be given the choice to communicate their decision to the opposing participant prior to making their selection of action. Participants may also be given the opportunity to do so multiple times prior to making their selection. This process proceeds as follows.
The participant is asked if they would like to make an announcement. They may select either yes or no.
If they select yes, they will be asked what they would like to announce. They may select any of the actions that will be available to them during the decision-making period. The opposing participant will then be told of their selection.
If they select no, the opposing participant will be told an announcement was not made.
After all communications are complete, the participants will then independently select their actions, and each will receive the number of points corresponding to this combination of actions in their table. They are not required to select the action they previously announced. At the end of each round, a lottery will take place, in which a ticket numbered from 0 to 1,000 will be drawn. If the number on the ticket drawn is less than or equal to the number of points the participant earned, they will be awarded a small amount of cash. 


## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for each participant is to maximize their earnings. The participants increase their chances of winning in the lottery by maximizing the points earned through the decision-making round. In all rounds, participants are required to make choices for their announcements (if applicable) and their actions in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical thinking, Decision-making

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Viewing current payoff matrix for assigned position, Clicking to select whether or not to make an announcement, Clicking to select what to announce, Viewing other participantâ€™s announcement, Experiencing a sequence of communication rounds prior to action selection, Clicking to select their action for the round, Viewing current winnings, Viewing number generated in lottery vs points earned, Playing rounds with different partners in sequence



### Other Allowed Processes
The payoff matrices are different depending on their current assignment, The values within the payoff matrices can be manipulated, The number of actions to select from can be manipulated, The number of announcements and their arrangement (only one player is given the option, both are given the option, both are given the option three times) varies and can be manipulated
