# Crisis mapping

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a crisis mapping tool on a computer, a collection of pre-processed 1567 tweets about Typhoon Pablo in Philippines posted on December 4th and 5th of 2012 and detailed instructions on how to navigate the crisis mapping interface.

Some of the tweets contain information relevant to the typhoon, such as evacuation centers, damaged infrastructure or number of deaths, while some tweets are irrlevant to the disaster.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to select relevant tweets and geo-locate, time-stamp, and categorize damage/flooding photos and videos in them to create a precise and accurate crisis map for Typhoon Pablo within a fixed amount of time.

Experimenters predefine "the gold standard" map with 49 distinct events in different regions. The map misses some of relevant events and allows for variations and it is impossible to receive a score higher than the golden map. Participants are evaluated based on how close their map is to the golden standard map. In other words, the goal is to build a precise map of the disaster.
