# The beer game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to a group of four acting as retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and factory. Customer demand (in kegs of beer) arises only at the retailer, which replenishes its inventory from the wholesaler, the wholesaler from the distributor, and the distributor from the factory. The demands in different periods are independent and identically distributed random variables. The demand distribution is known to all the players. Material flows from upstream to downstream (i.e. from the factory to the distribution center, then to the warehouse, and finally to the retail store). In contrast, the information in the form of replenishment orders flows in the opposite direction. Both the material and information flows are subject to delays. There is an order processing delay, or information lead time, between when an order is placed and when the supplier receives the order.

Here is an example. Suppose the retail store orders 10 kegs from the warehouse on Monday. The warehouse receives this order on Wednesday. This information delay is due to the administrative steps in processing an order. On Wednesday, however, the warehouse only has 5 kegs of beer, so it ships 5 kegs to the retail store and backlogs the remaining 5. This shipment of 5 kegs arrives at the retail store on Friday. This delay is due to transportation.

In each period, the channel members must decide how much, if any, to order from their respective suppliers and the factory must decide how much, if any, to produce.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to minimize the total holding and backorder costs incurred in the entire supply chain and optimize the system-wide performance. Holding costs are incurred at each station for their on-hand inventories, and backorder costs are incurred only at the retail store for customer backorders.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
supply chain management skills, analytical skills, reasoning skills, critical thinking

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Placing an order with the upstream supplier. Typing the number of kegs to order.

### Other Allowed Processes
Tracking inventory level and outstanding orders for the players and allowing players to take a look at the history record
