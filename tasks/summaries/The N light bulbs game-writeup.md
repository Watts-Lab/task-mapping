# The N light bulbs game

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see 10 light bulbs.

Some of the light bulbs can be turned "on" or "off" by clicking on them. Other light bulbs are stuck --- they are either on or off, and they cannot be changed. The light bulbs that are stuck are marked with a big "X."

Different patterns of light bulbs are worth different numbers of points. For example, maybe an alternating pattern --- on, off, on, off, etc. --- has the highest points for this round of the game. However, participants do not know that this is the best pattern.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to get the most points by setting the lightbulbs to a pattern that maximizes the point value. 

This means participants have to switch the light bulbs (that are not stuck) on and off to try to figure out which configurations have the highest payoff. For each guess, participants only get to change one light bulb (turn it "on" or "off") at a time. There are a limited number of guesses. If working in teams, everyone collectively determines the next guess.

The computer will give feedback and tell the participant how many points they earned after each guess. While there is a theoretical "best" configuration,  participants will not be told if they have achieved it; they only know how many points the guess is worth. It's possible, for example, that they make a guess that gets to the optimal point value, but then make another guess that performs worse. Participants also have the option to end the round early if they are happy with their guess.

A final useful piece of information is that the lightbulbs can be thought of as binary variables (a 0 or 1), which would then allow this game to be played by an algorithm.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Problem solving, group work.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Receive instructions, view NK-landscape, change a state of one lightbulb in each round, receive information about payoff for each round, return to previous solution before a new round started.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
