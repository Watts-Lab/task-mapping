# Sender-Receiver game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
### 

Participants are randomly paired for a communication-based game where one player sends a message to another who then chooses an action that determines their payoff. Player 1 is told to send a message to player 2 about two options for winning different payoffs. The two possible messages are: “Option A will earn you more money than option B” and “Option B will earn you more money than option A”. Player 1 can choose to tell the truth or lie to player 2 and player 2 can choose to heed or ignore the advice of player 1. The choice of the receiver will determine the payments of both players in the experiment.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are explicitly instructed that their goal is to maximize their individual payoff, and are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to send a message and make a decision.
