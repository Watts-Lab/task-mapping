# Sender-Receiver game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
### 

Participants are paired for a communication-based game where one player sends a message to another, and the second player then chooses an action that determines their payoff. Player 1 is told to send a message to Player 2 about two options for winning different payoffs. The two possible messages are: "Option A will earn you more money than Option B" and "Option B will earn you more money than Option A". Player 1 can choose to tell the truth or to lie to Player 2, and Player 2 can choose to heed or to ignore the advice of Player 1. The choice of the receiver will determine the payments of both players in the experiment.

Here is a concrete example. Suppose that the true options are: (Option A) Player 1 gets $5 and Player 2 gets $6; (Option B) Player 1 gets $6 and Player 2 gets $5. 

Player 1 will see the true options, and they can either choose to tell Player 2 the truth (saying, "Option A will earn you more money than Option B") or lie (saying, "Option B will earn you more money than Option A"). If they tell the truth, and Player 2 listens to them, then Player 1 will end up with less money in the end ($5 rather than $6). On the other hand, if they lie, they can potentially influence Player 2 to (unknowingly) choose the option that is better for Player 1. Meanwhile, because Player 2 knows that Player 1 may be lying, they can choose to either follow the advice or to ignore it. In the end, both players receive the payoffs from Player 2's choice, but Player 2 is not informed of how much Player 1 received (so they do not ever find out whether they were "correct" or not.)

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, Player 1 must decide which message will lead to Player 2's choosing an advantageous outcome; Player 2 must decide whether or not to trust Player 1, so that they can obtain their own advantageous outcome. Participants are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to send a message and make a decision.
