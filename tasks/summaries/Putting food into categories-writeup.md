# Putting food into categories

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants were provided with a shared list containing several (e.g., a dozen) fruit and vegetable items (e.g., orange, grapes).

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to generate different the maximum number of categories that could be used to divide the food items. Within a limited amount of time, they had to come up with as many criteria as they could to classify the items into subgroups (e.g., citrus vs non-citrus, tropical vs non-tropical, seeds versus no seeds).
