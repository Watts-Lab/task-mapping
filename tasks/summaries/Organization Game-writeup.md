# Organization Game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly assigned to one of four equal size but physically separated divisions, each having its own complement of operating (line and staff) units. With the minimal structure and only unit heads and resource controllers assigned, participants must decide how to further develop and staff the organization in order to achieve an effective system for the division and coordination of work. These processes must include a way for the organization to learn and change as it adapts to internal and external forces.

## 2. Goal Directives 
To goal is to maximize the organizational effectiveness score based on several objective performance indicators. Factors that will impact the score include the productivity of line units, investments in organizational development programs, and events such as members' absence, strikes, dismissals, resignations, vacations, and underutilization. The indicators for each session of play are calculated by the coordinator and delivered to the information processing unit at the beginning of the next session.
