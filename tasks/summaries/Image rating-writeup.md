# Image rating

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see pictures of a series of products and accompanying slogans for them. They then have the opportunity to rate the product and slogan on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best). Participants see these pictures one at a time.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to give a rating that is as close as possible to how other Americans viewed the product and slogan. The challenge is to be exact in predicting how other Americans think. 

Participants receive points based on how close their ratings are to the "truth." The "truth" is calculated based on the average poll response of 100 American users on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants are NOT told whether their guesses are correct or how many points they earned.

Finally, participants have to make their decisions within a limited amount of time.
