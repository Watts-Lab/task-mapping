# Iterative lemonade stand task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given an excel program that represents managing a lemonade cart. The program allows users to tweak five variables: price, lemon content, sugar content, lemonade color, and location of a lemonade cart. There are limited options for lemonade color and cart location that are predefined within the task. For example, lemonade can only be either yellow or orange, and a cart can either stand in the park or near the supermarket. Price can be any number participant decides to use, while lemon and sugar content can be any value between 0 and 100 percent.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to maximize the cart's revenue by adjusting five given variables within a fixed amount of time. For example, participants can decide to sell their orange lemonade in the park with 20% lemon content and 5% sugar content for $3 a glass. There is a formula in the program that quantifies the cart's revenue and participants see it as an instant feedback.

Participants are evaluated based on their profit. The more profit their cart makes after they tweak variables, the better is their performance on the task.
