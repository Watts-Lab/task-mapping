# Object based generalization for reasoning (Phyre)

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get a series of puzzles related to properties of physical bodies in a simulated 2D world on a computer. The access is given to all puzzles at once and participants can choose which puzzles to work on.

For example, in one of the puzzles participants can view an environment with two blue and green balls on little platforms floating in space and a tilted floor at the bottom. Considering this scenario, participants are asked to make the green ball and blue ball touch.

Participants are expected to solve puzzles by adding physical bodies to the environment so that when the physical simulation is run the puzzle gets solved.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to solve as many puzzles in as few attempts as possible within a fixed amount of time. The maximum score occurs when all puzzles are solved during first attempts. 

After each unsuccessful attempt, the environment resets to its initial state and participants can try again until they run out of time, solve the puzzle or decide to try a different puzzle.



## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Physical reasoning

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
View all puzzles, click on puzzle, add physical object, run the physical simulation.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
