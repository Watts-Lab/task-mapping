# Minimal Group Paradigm (study diversity)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly and anonymously divided into two groups (e.g., "Group A" and "Group B"), ostensibly on the basis of trivial criteria (e.g., preference for paintings or the toss of a coin). After that, participants take part in an ostensibly unrelated resource distribution task. During this task, participants distribute a valuable resource (e.g., money or points) between other participants who are only identified by code number and group membership (e.g., "participant number 34 of Group A"). Participants are told that, after the task is finished, they will receive the total amount of the resource that has been allocated to them by the other participants.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to exclude "objective" influences from the situation and distribute the resources to others. People are not instructed that they should maximize team resources or personal resources. They should allocate all the resources they own to other participants, including those not in their same team.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
analytical skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants can input the number of resources to allocate to other players. They can allocate resources to more than one person.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants cannot communicate during the resource allocation stage
