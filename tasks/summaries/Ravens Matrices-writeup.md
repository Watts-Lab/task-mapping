# Ravens Matrices

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are presented with a pattern, which looks like a matrix or grid with a white background. There is a missing piece to the pattern.

Here is an example to help you imagine what the pattern might look like. Participants could see a grid with four spaces. In the first space they see a square, divided into four pieces, with one piece colored in. Then, in the second space, there is a square with two of four pieces colored in. In the third space, there is a sqaure with three of four pieces colored in. After the first three steps in the pattern, there would be a blank space on the grid.

Participants would then see a few multiple-choice options for what could fill the blank space. For example, they could choose between a square with one, two, three, or four pieces filled in.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to complete the pattern by identifying what the missing piece should be. 

In the example above, the correct answer is that the fourth space should have a square with four pieces colored in.

The problem is multiple-choice, so participants will choose just one correct answer from a variety of options. There is always exactly one correct answer in the multiple-choice problem.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.
