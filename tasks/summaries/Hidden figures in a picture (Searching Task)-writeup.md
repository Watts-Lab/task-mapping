# Hidden figures in a picture (Searching Task)

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see an incredibly busy and complex image that contains many hidden animals. Imagine a picture that looks like "Where's Waldo" --- with lots of people and animals in one detailed, colorful image. Participants are then given a list of animals that they are supposed to find in the picture: for example, lion, penguin, dolphin, elephant.

If working together, participants in a team see the same picture and have the same list of animals to find.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the task is to successfully identify the locations (in the image) of as many animals as possible from the list. Participants must find the most animals they can within a limited period of time.

Participants submit their response by pointing and clicking on the correct location of the animal, and they get points for every animal that they are able to find. Thus, they would get the highest score if they find all animals on the list. If participants are working together, only one person on the team needs to click on the animal in order for it to be counted, which means that having members of a team search separately is advantageous.
