## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Alternate versions of the experiment allow you to introduce teams.  These experiments allow you to test the effects of group negotiations.  Different formats tested in, The agreement bias in negotiation: Teams facilitate impasse were, one-on-one, two-on-two and three-on-three.


# Procedure
Groups of participants were selected from MBA students.  (At this point you can break the groups into teams, or use one-on-one negotiations. Teams are assigned randomly.)  Participants are then given their role materials one week prior to negotiations.

On negotiation day, both parties are to attempt to reach deal while acting in their roles.  

After negotiations cease participants should report whether they have reached an agreement or an impasse.  These should be coded, i.e. agreement(0) and impasse(1).

## Steps
1. (Optional) break participants into groups
2. Disperse role materials to participants one week prior to negotiations
3. Allow participants to negotiate
4. After negotiations conclude, ask participants to report if they reached a deal. (i.e. agreement(0) and impasse(1))
