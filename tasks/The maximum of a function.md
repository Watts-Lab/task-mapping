## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> There were individual and group versions of the task
> > Individuals completed the Optimization task three times. A different underlying function was used each time

# Procedure
## Steps
Pretest: All participants took two tests, a shortened version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and a short version of the Big 5 inventory

As the participants arrived, they were assigned to groups of three. Participants were ordered according to their mean performance across the individual problem-solving tasks (Memory, Optimization
and Shapes), and ordered as higher-skill, medium-skill, and lower-skill

Individual:
> Step one: Participants were given a function, which was hidden to them, and had 15 guesses to find the maximum
> 
> > Guesses had to be between 0 and 300
> > 
> Step two: Once participants had entered 15 guesses, they were asked to submit their answer for the input value that maximized the output

Group
> Step one: Each group of three people worked face-to-face in a single room. The tasks were computer based and each participant was provided with a laptop. We began each group session by asking group members to
introduce themselves. 
>
> Step two: Then, groups were required to nominate a ‘Reporter’. The Reporter was responsible for entering their group’s answers. Participants also gathered around the Reporter’s laptop
for some tasks.
>
> Step three: Participants were given a function, which was hidden to them, and each participant had 5 guesses to find the maximum (for a group total of 15)
> > Each group member entered their own guesses on their own laptop
> > Each group solved the Optimization task twice

## Roles 
> In the group, one participant was the Reporter, who entered the group’s answer for the output-maximizing input after each participant in the group submitted their own guesses

## Instructions
Group Instructions: Welcome everyone! My name is ___, thanks for joining us for today’s session. The plan for today is for you to work on a set of tasks very similar to those that you completed in the individual, online assessments. Today we’ll be working in person, in groups of three people.
First, we are going to jumble you up into groups of three people using randomization balls. Once you get your ball, keep hold of it for the whole session. It will tell you who you will be working with throughout the session.
Based on the randomization ball, we’ll put you into your first group for today. After solving some tasks, you’ll come back here after roughly 25 minutes. Then, we’ll put you in your second group, and you’ll solve some more tasks. All these tasks will be similar to ones you’ve done before.
“Remember you’re working as a group, even though you each have your own laptop. There are no individual scores: you’re working as a team to solve problems.”

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
>Success on the group Optimization task required collective planning and the sharing of unique information.
>Individual and Group performance was measured, accounting for differences in task difficulty and endowment of individual skill

## Incentives
> Participants who completed the study were paid a total of $100: $10 for completing the individual tests; $30 for lab visit 1; and $60 for lab visit 2.
