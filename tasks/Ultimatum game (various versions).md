# Summary
One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money and can split it with another player (the responder). The responder then can accept or reject the money. If the offer is accepted, both players split the money. If the offer is rejected, both players leave with nothing. The game is usually played over several rounds.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
### competitive ultimatum game : 
There are many proposers and the responder can accept at most one of their offers: With more than three (naive) proposers the responder is usually offered almost the entire endowment 
  
### ultimatum game with tipping: 
 A tip is allowed from responder back to proposer, a feature of the trust game, and net splits tend to be more equitable.
   
### reverse ultimatum game: 
 Gives more power to the responder by giving the proposer the right to offer as many divisions of the endowment as they like. Now the game only ends when the responder accepts an offer or abandons the game, and therefore the proposer tends to receive slightly less than half of the initial endowment
   
### Incomplete information ultimatum games: 
 Some authors have studied variants of the ultimatum game in which either the proposer or the responder has private information about the size of the pie to be divided
   
 The pirate game illustrates a variant with more than two participants with voting power
  
  # Instructions 
Rounds and Matchings: The experiment consists of a number of rounds. Note: You will be matched with the same person in all rounds.

Decisions: One of you will be designated as a Proposer (initial decision-maker) who will begin the round by proposing a division of an amount of money, $10.00. The other person, designated as responder, is told of the proposed division and must either accept it or not.

Role: You have been randomly assigned to be a Proposer (or initial decision-maker) in this process, and you will begin by suggesting amounts of money for each of you that sum to $10.00.

OR Role: You have been randomly assigned to be a Responder in this process. The other person (proposer) will begin by suggesting amounts of money for each of you that sum to $10.00.

Earnings: If the responder accepts the proposed division, then each person earns their part of the proposed division. If the responder rejects, both earn $0.00.

Please remember that you will be matched with the same person in all rounds.

The proposer (initial decision-maker) in each pair suggests a division of the $10.00; this proposal determines earnings for the round if it is accepted. A rejection produces earnings of $0.00 for each person. If the proposal is rejected, earnings are $0.00 for both proposer and responder.

There will be a number of rounds, and you are always matched with the same person.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money. The proposer is tasked with splitting it with another player, the responder. 
2. Once the proposer communicates his decision, the responder may accept it or reject it. If the responder accepts, the money is split per the proposal; if the responder rejects, both players receive nothing. 
3. Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or rejecting the offer
4. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent, e.g., performance on one step influences what is seen on another step, this should be described in full detail.

## Roles 

The proposer- endowed with a sum of money  

The responder- decides to accept or reject money from proposer.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Proposer Offer Amount
  
Responder acceptance rate of proposer offer 

## Incentives
They are offered money for accepting, usually participants are not given a show-up fee
