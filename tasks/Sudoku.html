  The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row,
  and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes",
  "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle
  setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has
  a single solution.
