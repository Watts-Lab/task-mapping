# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were randomly assigned to act as seller or buyer in the Energetics Meets Generex negotiation (negotiationexercises.com). 
> The seller, Energetics, represents a large energy company interested in selling its wind division. 
> The buyer, Generex, represents a large power company interested in buying the division. Buyers had two alternatives, one relatively cheap and one relatively expensive: buy a much smaller wind division in a less-attractive market for $220 million, or develop a comparable facility from scratch for $350 million with a 3-year delay. The seller’s BATNA was to sell their assets piecemeal for a profit of $170 million. Thus, a positive bargaining zone between $50 and $180 million made a profitable deal possible for both parties. 
2. Participants prepared for 20 min and negotiated for 30. 
3. At the end of the negotiation, each dyad completed an agreement sheet asking which party made the first offer and the value of the final selling price

The the negotiation packet contained the experimental manipulation. Labeled “Negotiation Instructions,” it said, “For this negotiation, the [BUYER/SELLER] will make the first offer. The [BUYER/SELLER] will make the first statement and present an offer to the [SELLER/BUYER].” Both members of each dyad received the same instructions and no further information about the offer (e.g., how many issues it should contain).

# Criteria
