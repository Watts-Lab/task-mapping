# Summary
Participants take place in a two-party dispute concerning a real estate developer (high power) and the owner of a carpentry business (low power) who have a complex business relationship. The two parties need to determine who will pay for the cost of expensive wood in a new development outside the scope of their current budget. Unfortunately, if the low-power party is not paid, he or she may be forced into bankruptcy, leaving the high-power party vulnerable to claims of unjust enrichment.  They have one hour to negotiate regarding a loan for the wood, rental property payments and a lease agreement. 

Although the high-powerparty has a clearly advantageous bargaining position, the low-power party may threaten to take the other party to court if thematter cannot be resolved by the end of the session. This would bean expensive and damaging outcome for both partie.

# Procedure
## Steps
Surveys: 
1. Participants complete a series of surveys on psychological measures included the he Singelis Interdependence Scale (Singelis, 1994), which measures chronic levels ofindependent and interdependent self-construals
2. To select participants representing these categories, our selection criteria stated that participants must be in the top half of the class on the relevant subscale and must score at least .25 points higher on that subscale than on the other subscale.

Experiment: 
1. The experiment is held 4-6 weeks after testing sessions.
2. Approximately 1 week prior to the negotiation, participants were given information describing the dispute situation and were randomly assigned to a high power or low power condition 
3. At the beginning of the data collection session, participants received a packet of materials, and they were asked to read through it carefully. The packet began with an instruction sheet that introduced the experimental manipulation. Both versions of the questionnaire packet described the packet contents and noted that students were to read an attached negotiation case and to answer questions about the case. Each participant was asked to complete a questionnaire that assessed his or her expectations and intentions for the negotiation. 
> The dyadic version of the instructions noted thatstudents were to read the attached negotiation exercise and to indicate how they thought they would feel as they were about to sit down and negotiate this case with another individual. 
> The group version advised participants that they were to indicate how they thought their team would feel as they were about to sitdown and negotiate with another team. The packet contained the dispute case materials, specific case-related questions, and finally,questions about participant demographics
> Note Participants are asked to read a prime adapted from Trafimow, Triandis, and Goto (1991) and consisted of a short story describing a general who must select a representative to send to his king.  
>  In the independent prime, the general’s decision is based onindividual attributes, and the course of action was chosen to reflect well on him, 
>  In the interdependent prime, the general’s choice is based on community ties and the course of action was chosen to reflect well on the entire kingdom. 
5. At the end of the story, participants were asked to indicate how well reasoned they considered the warrior’s decision to be. 
6. As part of what they believed was a separate task prior to the negotiation task, participants reread the story and write a paragraph discussing the similarities between this decision-making task and the features of modern corporate decision making
7. Participants were then directed to their assigned rooms to meet with the other party for 60 min.  
8. As part of what they believed was a separate task prior to the negotiation task, participants reread the story and write a paragraph discussing the similarities between this decision-making task and the features of modern corporate decision making. 
9. Participants were randomly assigned to the high power or low power role and either given the independent or interdependence prime. 
10. Participants were told that the decision-making task and the Viking negotiation were separate cases and that the tasks would be debriefed following the 60-min negotiation exercise.
11. When they returned, they completed a final contract,outlining their agreement. Finally, there was a thorough debriefingand discussion of the negotiation.
12. In the debriefing, none of the participants reported a belief that the prime was related to the negotiation task

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance was calculated on three main areas: 
- The main component of the negotiation relates to the amount of money that the high-power party paid to the low-power party (Amount paid by the high-power party beyond the amount legally owed)
> Condominium Complex: calculate the amount the high-power party agreed to pay for the condiminium project above what was already agreed upon 
> Loan: The financial impact of the loan on the high-power party
> Back rent on lease: The high-power party leased commercialspace to the low-power party and the low-power party was 2 months behind in the rent.
> Future lease agreement: The lease agreement between the twoparties had ended and was available for cancellation or renewal

Impasse: The rate of impasse, the rate at which negotiators failed to reach an agreement in the 60 min allotted.
