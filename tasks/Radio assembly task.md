# Summary
The radio assembly task is an experiment where participants are broken into groups or left in an individual setting.  They were then showed how to assemble the FM portion of a radio, and were able to ask any questions.  One week later, groups met again and participants that were previously in the individual setting were put into groups.  They were asked to write down the steps to assemble the radio, and then were given 30 minutes to do so.

## Materials for the experiment 
Kits were purchased from Tandy Corporation (Model 28-175).  Each kit contained the circuit board and dozens of mechanical and electrical components.  The circuit board was prepunched and marked with special symbols that indicated which competent should be placed in a hole.  No special tools were provided, and the task required only inserting components into the circuit board and connecting each components to each other properly.

# Procedure
## Steps
During Phase 1 subjects were trained on how to assemble the radio.  Subjects in the group setting were assigned to groups of three, all same sex groups.  Participants selected for the individual setting went through training alone.

Both group and individual settings received a 15 minute demonstration on how to assemble the radio, the experimenter showed how to insert components into the circuit board, and how to connect the components and would answer questions.  The subjects could ask questions while the experimenter assembled the radio.  The subjects were then given 30 minutes to practice assembling the radio themselves, they could not assemble more than one radio.  the experimenter then reviewed the radio and offered insight on how to correct any errors.

Phase 2 would take place one week after phase 1.  Subjects trained individually were assigned to groups of 3 of the same sex, subjects trained in groups remained in those groups.  Both settings were tested the same way.

Groups were first asked to recall and write down the instructions for assembling the radio (they were given up to 7 minutes for this). They were able to discuss the process freely, but could not ask the experimenter any questions, or examine any radio components.

Groups were then given 30 minutes to assemble the radio.  They were asked to work as quickly as possible, but also make as few errors as possible.  They were not allowed to ask questions to the experimenter or examine their own recall sheet.  Each session was recorded with subjects permission.

After assembly was complete, each participants individually completed a questionnaire asking basic biographical information questions, such as age, sex, and prior familiarity with other group members.  They were also asked about the complexity of the task, and the enjoyment of the task.  They were also asked about their group, questions included cohesion, cooperation, role differentiation and memory differentiation. 

## Roles 
Participants were all trained on how to assemble the radio, in either a group or individual setting, and then assembled the radio in a group setting.

## Instructions
(Instructions were created by the CSS Lab)  
The task is to assemble the AM side of a Tandy Corporation (Model 28-175) radio.
Phase 1
- individually or as a group, watch an experimenter assemble the AM said of a radio.
- Ask any clarifying questions you may have.
- As a group you will be given a kit to practice with.  You will have thirty minutes, and once you complete assembly an experimenter will inspect your work and give you notes on what could be improved.
You will scheduled to return in one week.
Phase 2
- You and your group will write down all the steps you can recall to the radio assembly task.
- Once you have finished, or after 7 minutes has elapsed, we will take the instructions you have written down, and your group will have 30 minutes to assemble the radio.
- You are too assemble the radio as quickly and precisely as possible, ie. you want to be quick, but you should also avoid making errors where possible
- With your permission we will record the session.
The best performing group will receive a prize of $20 each.  After the completion of phase 2, you will complete a brief questionnaire.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Groups were judged off of however quickly and accurately they managed to assemble the radio. 

## Incentives
The best work group would receive a prize of $20 each.
