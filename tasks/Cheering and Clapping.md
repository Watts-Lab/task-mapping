# Summary
The clapping/shouting task is designed to task social loafing, the phenomenon that in a group setting some people may tend to work less hard than they would alone.  In this experiment participants were all male undergraduates.  They were broken into groups of six.  There were two forms of the task.  In one setting, the groups were seated in a semicircle, and they could all clearly tell who was shouting or clapping, in the second setting all participants were blind folded and given noise cancelling headphone with a loud track of groups shouting and clapping playing on loop, thus the could not tell if they were shouting alone.

# Procedure
## Steps
Experiment 1:
- One eight separate occasions groups of six male college students were taken into a sound proof room and seated in a semi circle.
- They were then given the instructions below.
- They were given some practice with producing sound and judging sound.
- There were then 36 trials of yelling/cheering and 36 of clapping, each person performed twice alone, four times in pairs, four times in groups of four, and six times in groups of six.  These performances were staggered so that no one had to perform twice in a row.
Experiment 2:
- Six groups of six male undergraduate students were tested.
- They were given the instructions below.
- Participants then put on their blindfolds and headsets.
- The trails were performed as follows:
    - 13 trials where each participants shouted four times in groups of six, once in a group of two and once by himself.  Before each trial, they would hear the letter corresponding to who was supposed to shout over their headset.
    - 12 trials, two for each participant, where special instructions were played leading the participant to believe that either one other person, or all six people would yell together, but in reality, they yelled alone.  These 12 trials were spread out throughout the other 13 trials.
- Trials were arranged so that everyone would have approximately equal rest periods between shouting.

## Roles 
Participants were broken into groups of six and asked to clap or shout.

## Instructions
Experiment 1:
- We are interested in judgements of how much noise people can make in social settings.  We want you to do two things, 1) make noises, and 2) judge noises.  One each trial the experimenter will tell you the trial number, who is to perform, and whether to cheer or clap.  The experimenter will count backwards from three, and then hold their hand up, you are to cheer or clap until they low their hand.  This duration will be approximately five seconds and we would like you to cheer or clap as loud as you can.

Experiment 2:
- We are interested in the effects of sensory feedback on the production of sound in social groups.  You will be asked to produce sound in groups of one, two, or six and we will record the output on a sound-level meter.  This is not a competition and you will learn your scores at the end.  We would like you to be as loud as possible.  You will be asked to wear blindfolds and earphones, so that none of the other participants will be able to see or hear who is shouting.  Note that the room is also sound proof, so no one outside of the room will hear you.  Please feel free to really let loose, we want you to be as loud as possible.  Are there any questions?

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance was measured by a General Radio sound-level meter, Model 1565A, using the C scale and the slow time constant.  The sound was read in decibels.  Also concerned with measuring the effort used in generating noise, the unit of work used in measuring sound pressure was used and results were measured in dynes/cm^2.

## Incentives
No incentives were mentioned
