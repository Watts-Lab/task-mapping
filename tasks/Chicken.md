# Summary
> Players either 'dare' or 'chicken out' simultaneously each leading to different payoffs depending on the decisions of both players. The principle of the game is that while the outcome is ideal for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yields), but the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. When one player yields the game is over.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were placed in separate cubicles with a PC in it. After starting the computer program, the experimenter explained that all communication with the experimenter and other participants would be via the PC
2. To begin with, participants completed four questionnaires, of which only one, a measure of risk orientation, is directly relevant to the present study
3. Participants were informed that in the next task they would play a kind of game with another participant for lottery tickets, which gave a chance of winning a CD gift voucher worth 20 euros. Participant and other would not compete for the same prizes. It was also explained that, to guarantee anonymity, all contact with the other player would be via the computer, without face-to-face contact or disclosure of identities afterwards.
4. Next, participants received instructions about the game in which one had to choose between A (cooperation) or B (defection); the words “cooperation” and “defection” were never used in the instructions.
5.At the moment participants make their choice, they do not know the choice of the other, and the other does not know their opponents choice. The number of
points that each of participant wins [loses] is determined by the combination of choices by both participants. 
6. After this, without being informed about the other’s choice, participants were asked a few manipulation check questions about game comprehension and framing, and a question about which choice (A or B) they perceive as the most risky one. The payoff matrix is onscreen while participants play the entire game. 
7. Finally, all participants were debriefed, paid, and thanked for their participation.


## Instructions
Summary: 
You will play for points. Your points are determined by both your and your partners decisions and vice versa
You will choose either option A or B
Option B may lead to the best or worst outcome, option A will always be second best or second worst
Please see Fig. 1 for visual

Exact Instructions: 
“In the next part, you will play for points, and each point represents a lottery ticket. How many points you will win [lose], will be determined not only by your own choice, but also by the choice of the other person. At the same time, his or her points are also partly determined by your choices. 
The game will be played as follows. You will have to make a choice between two possibilities, called A and B (the other will have to make the same choice). At the moment you make your choice, you do not know the choice of the other, and the other does not know your choice. The number of points that each of you wins [loses] is determined by the combination of choices by you and the other. As you can see in the figure below, there are four possible outcomes.” 

Next, one of the four payoff matrices from Fig. 1 was shown (with A and B instead of C and D), which remained on screen until participants had played their game. 
In addition, outcomes for the four possible combinations of choices were also explained in words. To make sure that participants understood the games, an explanation about the strategic implications of the payoff structure was given to the participant. Participants in the chicken game were told that choosing B might lead to the best possible outcome (if the other chooses A), but also to the worst possible outcome (if the other chooses B) for oneself, whereas choosing A can only lead to the second-best and second-worst outcomes.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Risk Orientation Measure was collected - Risk Orientation Questionnaire (ROQ: Rohrmann, 2002)

The two dependent measures were cooperative choice (did one choose cooperation or defection in the one-shot game?) and most risky option (did one indicate that cooperation (A) or defection (B) was the more risky option in this game?).

## Incentives
All participated voluntarily in this study (together with an unrelated study that followed the present study) in exchange for six euros.
