# Procedure
## Steps
> A task flow describing the stages a participant goes through and a formal specification of any conditional or complex relationships therein. 
> List the steps that make up the task. This could include a training protocol, pre and post surveys, task rounds, etc.  
> Describe the relationship between the steps. By default they are assumed to be chronological and have no interdependencies, but if they are not chronological, e.g., a choice changes the order of the steps, that should be described in full detail. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent, e.g., performance on one step influences what is seen on another step, this should be described in full detail.

## Roles 
> A description of roles if relevant to the task.  
> If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
> Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  
> Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  
> Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  
> This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 

## Incentives
> A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   
> Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
