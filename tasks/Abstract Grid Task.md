# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were told that the study was concerned with processesinvolved in social interaction. They were presented with a sequence of 10 puzzle pictures containing hidden animals. Each picture was shown for 30 stogether with the names of four target animals that participants were asked to find by pointing. The order of presenting pictures was the same in all conditions. 
2. Participants performed the task either individually or in pairs,and the experimenter corrected any target identification errors. As a dis-tracter task after this encoding phase, each person worked alone for 5 minto solve a word search task.
3. Next, participants were asked for written free recall of the targets. They were given 3 min to complete this task, which they performed individually in separate rooms. 
4. All participants then spent 2 min working individuallyon a distractor task that involved letter cancellation, after which they were given a further 3 min for a second free recall of the targets. On this critical retention trial, participants recalled either individually or in pairs. Those who recalled as a pair having previously encoded as a pair did so with the same partner. Pairs were encouraged to collaborate. 
5. No instructions were given about how to resolve disagreements. One member of each pair acted as a scribe. 
6. Immediately after the second recall, each person worked alone for 3 minon a distractor task in which they had to produce as many four letter wordsas possible from a given set of nine letters. The letters were such that none of the target words could be produced in this task.
7. Finally, all participants were given 3 min for free recall of the targets a third time working as individuals. At the end of the experiment, all participants were debriefed

## Roles 
In group tasks, a scribe wrote down the answers that the group came up with 

## Instructions
Not Available

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The numbers of correct items on each trial were obtained forall recall protocols. For comparisons involving collaborating pairs, nominal pairs were formed from random combinations of participants who recalled alone. Recall scores for nominal pairs were obtained by combining the individual recall protocols and allowing for any redundant items thatappeared in both. 

## Incentives
Participants were paid volunteers but payment is unknown 

# Summary


# References
Provide a full reference and link to the main paper and any subsequent papers used in the process of finding details about the task

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
A task flow describing the stages a participant goes through and a formal specification of any conditional or complex relationships therein. 

List the steps that make up the task. This could include a training protocol, pre and post surveys, task rounds, etc.  

Describe the relationship between the steps. By default they are assumed to be chronological and have no interdependencies, but if they are not chronological, e.g., a choice changes the order of the steps, that should be described in full detail. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent, e.g., performance on one step influences what is seen on another step, this should be described in full detail.

## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  

Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  

This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 

## Incentives
A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   

Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
