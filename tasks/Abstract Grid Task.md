# Procedure
## Steps
1. First, participants viewed a practice grid and read instructions: “Click spaces below to see how squares can be manipulated.” Clicking on any square would toggle it between white (blank) and green (filled). In the control condition participants proceeded right to the critical trial. In the repeated search condition, participants first completed practice trials on three similar grids but received no external feedback on their responses. The repetition merely gave them more opportunities to recognize the shortcomings of an additive approach.
2. After familiarizing themselves with the workspace, participants read, “On the following pages, you will be shown patterns. For each one, your job is to arrange the blocks so that the left side perfectly mirrors the right side, and vice-versa.” 
3. Participants then saw examples of correct and incorrect transformations. 
4. Next, participants continued to the main task, which included six trials. On each trial (presented in random order for each participant), participants saw one grid, with the instruction to: “Arrange the blocks so that the left side perfectly mirrors the right side and vice-versa. ONLY CONTINUE WHEN THE TWO SIDES ARE SYMMETRICAL.”
5. After completing all six trials, participants indicated their approach to changing the grids, “In general, what was your approach to make the sides symmetrical?”, with two response options: “I added squares until they were symmetrical” or “I removed squares until they were symmetrical.”


## Instructions
“Click spaces below to see how squares can be manipulated.” 
“On the following pages, you will be shown patterns. For each one, your job is to arrange the blocks so that
the left side perfectly mirrors the right side, and vice-versa.” 
“Arrange the blocks so that the left side perfectly mirrors the right
side and vice-versa. ONLY CONTINUE WHEN THE TWO SIDES ARE SYMMETRICAL.”
“In general, what was your approach to make the sides symmetrical?”, with two response options: “I added squares until they were symmetrical” or “I removed squares until they were symmetrical.”
