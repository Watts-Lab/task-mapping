# Summary
Participants have to solve a puzzle that requires that nine dots arranged in a square be connected by four straight lines drawn without lifting the pen from the paper and without retracing any lines

# Procedure
## Steps
1. At the beginning of the experiment, the experimenter told the participants that they would be learning several different pieces of knowledge that they would need to complete a problem at the end of the experiment. 
2. Using an overhead projector, the experimenter showed the participants the shape of the solution to the nine-dot problem and described it as having three lines that formed a triangle and a fourth line that cut the triangle in half (see Figure 5). 
3. Participants were instructed to remember the shape because they would need it for the next exercise and for a problem at the end of the experiment.  They were not shown how the four lines might be drawn. 
4. The participants then worked on a perceptual judgment task that followed the same visual training procedure as in Experiment 2, with the exception that participants were not shown the pattern of dots that make up the nine-dot problem and did not complete any shape recognition tasks.
5. Participants made 24 (12 target and 12 distractor) judgments and confidence ratings. 
6. After every judgment, the experimenter showed the participants the correct answer for that judgment and reminded the participants about the important features of the shape (a triangle cut in half by a fourth line). After completing the visual training, participants were once again told that they should remember the shape for use later in the experiment.
7. In the second part of the training, participants were instructed to connect dots by using a certain number of straight lines, analogous to the training in Experiment 1. The figures were presented in pairs, as in the follow-up to Experiment 1, such that a figure appeared on a grid of unfilled circles and subsequently appeared on a plain page. There were six pairs or 12 problems total. 
8. The experimenter said that there would sometimes be unfilled circles on the page and that the participants should use the unfilled
circles to connect the dots. Participants were also encouraged to remember where in the figure the unfilled circles were used because that would be important in solving a problem at the end of the experiment. 
9. After every two exercises, the experimenter showed the participants the correct answer for the previous pair of problems and pointed out that for the first problem of the pair unfilled circles were used and for the second problem of the pair the participants had drawn lines in blank space.
10. After the completion of the second part of the training, the experimenter reviewed the purpose of learning to connect dots and emphasized the importance of non-dot turns for completing the final problem. 
11. The experimenter then introduced the target problem by saying that the participants should remember what they learned about the shape of the problem and how to make non-dot turns when working on the target problem. The experimenter also suggested that participants could draw unfilled circles around the dots if they found it difficult to turn in empty space. The participants had 4 min to attempt the target problem. 

## Roles 
An experimenter was present and provided instructions to participants throughout the experiment 

## Instructions
Maier's Paper: Given nine dots through which four lines must be drawn in such a manner that all dots will eb passed through. The pencil must not be taken from the paper and no line should be retraced.
