# Summary
Groups of four participants were given 16 cards with images on them.  Their task was to work together to group the cards into four sets of four cards based on the images.

# Procedure
## Steps
Procedures for Experiment I:
1. Two training sessions  
    1st Training:  
     Cards were distributed in envelopes, each participant was given one envelope, each containing four cards. In this condition each individual was provided with two identical cards to provide a hint on how to form card categories.
     All participants were allowed to see each others cards without any barriers on the table.

    2nd Training:  
     The experimenter introduced a barrier across the table. The barrier allowed subjects to see one another and exchange cards easily but prevented them from seeing one anotherâ€™s cards. Cards were distributed using the same system as in the first training session. In the second training participants were given homogeneous, but non-identical cards. They had to describe their cards in order to find out what other group members had.

2. Three experimental conditions  
The procedure in the actual experimental conditions was identical to that used in the second training except that subjects were required to complete a questionnaire afterwards in the three actual experiments.

3. Three short questionnaires (after each of the three experiments)  
After the completion of each task, subjects were asked to fill a short questionnaire to describe some of their experiences (include rating the difficulty of the task, specifying the source of difficulty, and identifying the leader of the group if any).

Procedures for Experiment II:  
- Nine participants were selected randomly and asked if they would be willing and available to participate in a short study that would last approximately 45 minutes.
- Once the participants' time and availability were confirmed, they were given a questionnaire and 15 envelopes. Each set of cards was placed in a separate envelope.
- Each subject then rated the perceived similarity of the objects on the cards to the anchor object.
- The questionnaires were returned to the researcher after completion of the rating task.

## Roles 
Participants are to work with their group to create sets of cards based on the images on the cards

## Instructions
1. You will be performing three experiments with the potential to earn 1 bonus mark per experiment.
2. All data collected will be used solely for research purposes.  All film and videotapes will be used in support of the data analysis, and during research presentations at conferences.
3. A total of 16 cards will be distributed equally among 4 participants.
4. The goal is to come up with 4 of a kind.  I will demonstrate this using sample cards, note that the sample cards are simpler than the ones you will use in the experiment.
5. You will be awarded a half mark if you complete your set of 4 cards, and another half mark if the entire group completes their set of 4 cards.
6. There will be a 5 minute time limit for the first task, 10 minutes for the second and 15 minutes for the third.
7. You will then fill out a short questionnaire after the task.
8. You are allowed to exchange and trade cards among the group to complete sets, but do not take over another participants set of cards.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance is calulated by the amount of time taken, the number of card exchanges and the rate of card exchanges(card exchanges per minute).  The easier the task, the less time and fewer card exchanges should be needed to complete the sets.

## Incentives
Incentives for Experiment I:  
Undergraduate participants were given bonus marks towards their class, while graduate students were paid.

The undergraduate students were told that they would be awarded based on performance.  Specifically they were told they would be awarded 0.5 marks each time they completed their set of cards.  They were told they could earn an additional 0.5 marks every time their entire group completed their sets of cards.  However, each participant was awarded 3 bonus marks regardless of performance.

Incentives for Experiment II:  
No incentives were given for this experiment.
