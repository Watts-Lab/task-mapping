# Summary

Three participants and a robot work together to create train track routes. The goal of the task is to test whether the robot’s vulnerability would help to ease
group tension and facilitate positive group dynamics.

## The visual components

The participants were shown a board on their individual tablets and a bank of railroad pieces on the left side of the screen.

As participants placed pieces on the board, a piece from the bank of pieces was greyed out so that piece could no longer be selected.

Part four of the above image demonstrates what each tablet would display at the end of each round whether the group as a whole succeeded or failed.



Utterances in the neutral and vulnerable conditions were shown as if they were spoken by the robot after each player had completed their track and the team was shown their overall score (whether or not they successfully completed that round).

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 

The task was preprogrammed to win or lose a certain set of rounds.

On rounds programmed to lose, the final necessary piece of track was not available to the human during that round.

# Procedure
## Steps

Step 1: Participants are given consent form and a preexperiment survey upon arrival.



Step 2: They are taken into the experiment room, where they sat in a pre-determined layout facing a small table, the other participants, and the robot, named Echo



Step 3: They are told they would be playing a game, as a group, along with the robot. The game is to be described as "created for kindergarten-aged children" and they should be shown a high score board.



Step 4: They then begin the game tutorial on their personal tablet. The tutorial had two levels: level one allowing them to create a train track route without a time contraint, and level two with a time contraint. 



Step 5: When the game began, each participant had 5 seconds to place their track. There were 8 pieces to place each round. If a player did not lay a piece of track during the 5 second window, an available piece of track from the piece bank was selected and placed automatically. 



Step 6: There were 30 rounds players had to complete, and were preprogrammed in the following order:


7 winning rounds, 10 rounds (6 wins and 4 loses) wherein each participant (including Echo) made one mistake, an additional 10 rounds where each participant (including Echo) made another mistake, and 3 final winning rounds


Therefore, every group had the same score at the end of the game (22/30).




Step 7: At the end of the rounds, the robot says "goodbye" and the participants fill out a postsurvey. 

## Roles 

The three humans and the robot are meant to be equal contributers to the game.

Success was contingent on everyone in the group completing their part of the game successfully. In other words, if one person failed, everyone failed

## Instructions

ASK FOR INSTRUCTIONS!

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

The group’s score was the total number of successfully completed rounds for that group.

## Incentives

Participants received payment for their time, but amount was not mentioned.
