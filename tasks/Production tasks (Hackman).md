# Summary
Participants work in a group of 3 to complete production tasks (which are tasks calling for the production of ideas, images, or arrangements) by creating a written product.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
For production-type tasks, groups work with generalized “images.” Examples are “Write a story about this inkblot,” or “Describe a mountain scene.” 

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
N/A

# Procedure
## Steps
(a) Introduction to the experiment and administration of pretest instruments.
(b) Random partitioning of subjects into 108 three-man groups, one member designated as “leader” of the group, and the groups assigned to separate experimental rooms. Between three and seven groups were run in each experimental session.
(c) Instructions (over an intercommunication system) for the groups to begin work on the task.
(d) Fifteen minutes of work. Time warnings given at 5-minute intervals.
(e) Administration of a “Task Description Questionnaire”.
(f) Repeat of steps c-e for the second, third, and fourth tasks.
(g) Administration of post-test instruments.

The 108 experimental groups produced a total of 432 different written group products. (These products were assigned random identification numbers and then typed and mimeographed onto 5 x 8-inch cards.)

## Roles 
N/A One member was designated as “leader” of the group; however, no specific role description is given to the leader role.

## Instructions
Instructions developed by CSSLab:
There are 4 tasks to be completed in this experiment. Your task is to work as a team to create a written product based on the task assigned. You have 15 minutes to work on the task and a time warning will be given every 5 minutes during your work. You are required to complete a questionnaire after completing each task.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The primary measures of group-product characteristics used in the study are the six general dimensions developed by Hackman et ul. (1967). These dimensions are: action orientation, length, originality, optimism, quality of presentation, and issue involvement. They were supplemented by two dimensions assessing the adequacy with which a product met the specific requirements of the task that gave rise to it, and the overall judged "creativity” of a product.

General dimensions:
(a) Action orientation - the degree to which a product states or implies that a specific or general course of action should be, might be, or wi11 be followed.
(b) Length.
(c) Originality - the degree to which the ideas and/or mode of presentation of a product are fresh and unusual (not necessarily “good” or "creative”) as opposed to
obvious and mundane.
(d) Optimism - the degree to which the general point of view or tone of a product can be characterized as “positive” or optimistic as opposed to “negative” or pessimistic.
(e) Quality of presentation - evaluation of the grammatical, rhetorical, and literary qualities of a product.
(f) Issue involvement - the degree to which a product takes or implies a particular point of view regarding some goal, event, issue, value, or procedure.

Task-dependent dimensions:
(a) Global creativity
(b) The judged adequacy with which the product satisfied the specific requirements of the task. For example, if a task required a group to write a story about a polar bear, the adequacy dimension would assess the degree to which the product was indeed a “story” and “about a polar bear.”
