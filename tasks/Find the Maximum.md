# Procedure
## Steps
Phase One: Individual Testing
1. Most participants completed this element outside of the lab i.e. at home
2. In the individual Optimization task participants were given a function, which was hidden to them, and had 15 guesses to find the maximum. They entered guesses between 0 and 300. 
3. In Battery A, individuals completed the Optimization task three times. A different underlying function was used each time.

Phase Two: Group Testing
1. When participants arrived, they were asked to sign-in. Participants were ordered according to their score on individual tests. If there were ‘no shows’ and the total number of people in a session was not a multiple of 3, then we asked for volunteers to take a show-up fee ($5) and return to a different session.
2. Each group of three people worked face-to-face, in a separate room. The room contained:
- A rectangular table with 3 chairs
- 3 laptops. Each laptop was connected to wifi so that participants could access the task website.
3. At this point, experimenters followed the randomization procedure (we had 3 blocks, based on individual
skill: ‘low’, ‘medium’ and ‘high’). Each group had a member from each block. Participants randomly drew balls from 3 bags, under the supervision of the experimenters. 
> For example, in a session with n=9 participants, the three participants with the highest individual scores each drew a ball from the set {A,B,C}; participants with the middle three individual scores each each drew a ball from the set {D,E,F}, and the
remaining participants randomly drew a ball from the set {G,H,I}.
3. In the group version of the task, each group member was allocated 5 guesses. Collectively, the group had a total of 15 guesses. Each group member entered their own guesses on their own laptop. A critical feature of this task was the need to involve all three group members. Each group solved the Optimization task twice.
4. After the group had entered its 15 guesses, the Reporter was asked to enter the group’s answer for the output-maximizing   
5. After the group completed their first set of tasks (shapes, optimization, memory), the website asked them to return to the waiting area to be allocated to their second group. Once all groups had finished, experimenters used the randomization balls – and the randomization scheme – to allocate people to their second group. 

# Roles
The reporter was asked to enter the group's answer for the output maximizing input. 

## Instructions
Welcome everyone! My name is ___, thanks for joining us for today’s session. The plan for today
is for you to work on a set of tasks very similar to those that you completed in the individual,
online assessments. Today we’ll be working in person, in groups of three people.


First, we are going to jumble you up into groups of three people using randomization balls. Once
you get your ball, keep hold of it for the whole session. It will tell you who you will be working
with throughout the session.

Based on the randomization ball, we’ll put you into your first group for today. After solving some
tasks, you’ll come back here after roughly 25 minutes. Then, we’ll put you in your second group,
and you’ll solve some more tasks. All these tasks will be similar to ones you’ve done before.

Provided at Task Change: 
Remember you’re working as a group, even though you each have your own laptop. There are
no individual scores: you’re working as a team to solve problems.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Individual success at finding the maximum of a function 
Group success at finding the maximum of a function 

## Incentives
Participants who completed the study were paid a total of $100: $10 for completing the individual tests; $30 for lab visit 1;
and $60 for lab visit 2. Groups were not explicitly paid for better performance, relying instead on intrinsic motivation through priming.
