# Summary
Players within a group are provided with a set of numbers that they must choose from to make a payoff decision that reaches an efficient equilibrium point, with uncertainty testing payoff dominance. For example, if all players choose the highest value, the group reaches a pay-off dominant equilibrium, where players each receive the highest possible amount of money. If players choose different values, the group is in disequilibrium and they receive sub-optimal gains.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
There were three variations of the experiment that were used in seven experiments- see the payoff table image below: 

Treatment A and A': the following values were assigned to the parameters in equation (1): parameter a was set equal to $0.20, parameter b was set equal to $0.10,and a  constant of $0.60 was added to ensure that all payoffs were strictly positive. Consequently, the payoff-dominant equilibrium, (7, ... , 7), paid $1.30 while the secure equilibrium, (1,...,1), paid $0.70 per subject per period. This period treatment was repeated ten times and the number of players varied between 14-16 subjects

Treatment B: In treatment B, parameter b in equation (1) was set equal to zero, see payoff Table B. This gives the subjects a dominating strategy (play 7 regardless of the minimum), which eliminates the coordination problem

Treatment C: In treatment C, group size was reduced to two people who were strangers


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Subjects were read the instructions and no preplay or negotiation was allowed. Design parameters were altered resulting in a sequence of treatments labeled A, B, A'and C
2. Subjects were given the information about their payment parameters and a payoff table 
3. Subjects filled out a questionnaire to determine that they understood how to read the payoff table for treatment A, that is, map actions into money  payoff
4. After each repetition of the period game (which changed depending on treatment), the minimum  action was publicly announced and the subjects calculated their earnings for that period
5. Instructions for continuation treatments were given to the subjects after earlier treatments had been completed
6. Occasionally, subjects were asked to predict the actions of all the subjects in the treatment


## Instructions
This is an experiment in the economics of market decision  making. The instructions are simple. If you follow them closely and make appropriate decisions, you may make an appreciable amount of money. These earnings will be paid to you, in cash, at the end of the experiment.

In this experiment you will participate in a market of nine people. There will be a number of market periods. In each period every participant will pick a value of X. The values of X you may choose are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The value you pick forX and the median value of X chosen will determine the payoff you receive for that period. (The median choice is determined as follows. The choices made by the nine participants will be ordered from smallest to largest in numerical order. The median choice is the fifth from the bottom or the fifth from the top of the ordered choices. For example, to find the median of the nine numbers 33, 30, 30, 27, 34, 32, 34, 29, 32 arrange the numbers in ascending order-27, 29, 30, 30, 32, 32, 33, 34, 34-find the fifth choice counting either from the first number forward or the last number back of the ordered choices and that is the median value. In this example the median choice is 32.)

You are provided with a table that tells you the potential payoffs you may receive. Please look at the table now. The earnings in each period may be found by looking across from the value you choose on the left-hand side of the table and down from the median value chosen from the top of the table. For example, if you choose a 4 and the median value chosen is a 3, you earn 85 cents that period.

At the beginning of every period, each participant will write on a reporting sheet their participant number and the value of X they have chosen and hand it in to the experimenter. The median value of X chosen will be announced, and each participant will then figure out their earnings for that period. If you will now look at your record sheet, you will see the following entries: BALANCE, YOUR CHOICE OF X, MEDIAN  VALUE OF X CHOSEN, and YOUR EARNINGS. In the first period your BALANCE is $2. In the second period your BALANCE is the value of your earnings in the first period plus the $2 beginning balance. In the third period your BALANCE is the value of your BALANCE in the second period plus the value of your earnings in the second period. Please keep accurate records throughout the experiment.

To be sure that everyone understands the instructions, please fill out the sheet labeled questions and turn it in to the experimenter. DO NOT PUT YOUR NAME OR PARTICIPANT NUMBER ON THE QUESTION SHEET. If there are any mistakes on the question sheet, the experimenter will go over the instructions again.

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK THEM AT THIS TIME 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance was based on the payoff amount that participants gave and their earnings. 

## Incentives
Participants could keep what they earned at each round. The largest payoff in period one was $1.00 and some payoffs were $0.10. (The payoff-dominant equilibrium would have paid everyone $1.30. Additionally a subject was paid $0.70 less 0.02 times the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the actual and predicted actions.
