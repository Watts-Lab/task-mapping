# Stimuli
reached out to instructors 


# Procedure
## Steps
1. When participants arrived at the laboratory they were randomly assigned to participate in a team or, in the event of overscheduling, randomly selected for exclusion. 
2. Before meeting their teams, individuals completed a brief intelligence test (described below). 
3. Following the intelligence test, teams began working together on the group tasks in a private laboratory room.
4. Groups had ten minutes to complete as many of the 36 words they could 
4b. Other versions of the task use a different time period and different numbers of words, but the other features are the same. Additionally, this task comes from McGrath's broader set of tasks (quadrant 2 in his work) that are intellective: solving problems with a correct answer.
