# Summary
Groups were given a set of 36 words with 2-3 letters missing (ex." _ ech_ _ que" would be "technique"). Groups had 10 minutes to complete as many words as possible. Groups earned 1 point for each correctly spelled English word they completed.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. When participants arrived at the laboratory they were randomly assigned to participate in a team or, in the event of overscheduling, randomly selected for exclusion. 
2. Before meeting their teams, individuals completed a brief intelligence test (described below). 
3. Following the intelligence test, teams began working together on the group tasks in a private laboratory room.
4. Groups had ten minutes to complete as many of the 36 words they could 
4b. Other versions of the task use a different time period and different numbers of words, but the other features are the same. Additionally, this task comes from McGrath's broader set of tasks (quadrant 2 in his work) that are intellective: solving problems with a correct answer.
# Alternative Procedure
## Steps

1. Participants arrive and are told participants that they were looking at a list of 98 words with letters missing (varying in number), and that their task was to fill in the blanks to make complete words by themselves
2. Participants were given three minutes to complete as much of the word task as
they could. 
## Instructions
Instructions developed by CSS lab 

You will be given a set of 36 words with 2-3 letters missing (ex." _ ech_ _ que" would be "technique"). You will have 10 minutes to complete as many
words as possible.  Your group will earn 1 point for each correctly spelled English word you complete. 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Groups recieved one point for every word they completely correctly  
Alternative:  Participant responses were coded into the following categories: aggressive words, neutral words, ambiguous words, and non-words.
## Incentives
All participants were paid for their participation.
