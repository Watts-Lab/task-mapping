# Summary
The Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma-Maximizing Difference(IPD-MD) is a game where participants are broken into groups and then isolated.  Each participant is then given provisions and is then given options on how to spend that provision. The options can be boiled down to 1)helping the group, 2)hurting the other group, 3)acting selfishly.

# Procedure
## Steps
Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma(IPD)
- Six participants are split into two groups, with three people per group, no communication between participants
- Each participant is taken to their own room, and given instructions to the game
- Participants are given a short quiz that tests their knowledge of the game
    - If communication was allowed, participants were allowed to meet with their group members for 5 minutes of free discussion, then return to their rooms to make their decisions, otherwise skip this
- They are then asked to distribute their tokens amongst the options, their choice is then filled out on a decision sheet
- Participants are then asked to fill out a post game questionnaire assessing their expectations

Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma - Maximizing Difference(IPD-MD)
- Six participants are split into two groups, with three people per group, no communication between participants
- Each participant is taken to their own room, and given instructions that use neutral language (pools are referred to as A and B)
- Participants are given a short quiz that tests their knowledge of the game
    - If communication was allowed, participants were allowed to meet with their group members for 5 minutes of free discussion, then return to their rooms to make their decisions, otherwise skip this
- They are then asked to distribute their tokens amongst the options, their choice is then filled out on a decision sheet
- Participants are then asked to fill out a post game questionnaire assessing their expectations

## Roles 
Participant, is placed in a group at random and plays the game as instructed

Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma(IPD)
- Six participants are split into two groups, with three people per group, no communication between participants
- Each participant gets 10 tokens, and can contribute as many as they want to the group
    - For each token contributed to the group, everyone in the group gains 1 money unit(MU), and every member of the out group loses 1 MU
    - For each token kept by a participant, the participant is paid 2 MU

Intergroup Prisoner’s Dilemma - Maximizing Difference(IPD-MD)
- Six participants are split into two groups, with three people per group, no communication between participants
- Each participant gets 10 tokens, each token is worth 2 MU, and can contribute as many as they want to one of the two pools, the “within-group pool”(pool W) or the “between-group pool”(pool B)
    - For each token contributed to pool W, everyone in the group gains 1 MU
    - For each token contributed to poo B, everyone in the group gains 1 MU, and everyone in the other group loses 1 MU

- Alternate version allows for communication within the group before making their independent decisions.
    - If communication was allowed, participants were allowed to meet with their group members for 5 minutes of free discussion, then return to their rooms to make their decisions
    - Participants were told that their decision would be kept confidential

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The experimenter should track the decisions made by the participants, i.e. where they want to contribute(in IPD, if they contribute to the group, or in IPD-MD, which pool or pools they contribute to), and how much they decide to contribute.

This will also allow you to track group efficiency, i.e. how well the group did at maximizing the profits for group members.


## Incentives
- Each participant was paid a base of 30NIS (new Israeli schekel), so that no one would have a negative payment, the outcome of the game was then added or subtracted from this creating their actual payment 
    - Each token in pool W or B added 1 NIS to each in group participants payout
    - Each token in pool B subtracts 1 NIS from each out-group participants payout
    - Each token kept adds 2 NIS to the participants payout
- Overall payout was between 10 and 70 NIS
