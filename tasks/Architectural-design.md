# Summary
> Groups were asked to design a house, garage, and pool from a limited set of building blocks and adhere to provided criteria (i.e. building codes)

# Stimuli
## The visual components
> [to-do]

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  
> In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
> 1. Participants were given written and video instructions of building task. 
> 2. The participants were given scoring information. The scoring was purposefully complex to encourage trade-offs. 
> 3. The room was video taped with the knowledge and consent of all participants
> 4. After the video was shown, teams were given 10 minutes to work on a worksheet. The worksheet was used to decide tasks, rough-draft building structure, and a division of roles. 
> 5. Teams turned the worksheet in to the experimenter.
> 6. Teams were given 40 minutes to complete building task.
> 7. At 20 minutes, the team was told 20 minutes had past.
> 8. At 35 minutes, the teams were told 5 minutes were remaining. 


## Instructions
### The following rules were shown to the participants (verbatim):

#### House
**Square footage (each “knob” is equal to one square foot):**
• $10 per square foot on the ground floor
• $20 per square foot on the second floor
• $50 per square foot on subsequent floors
**Quality: assessed using the “lift, flip, and drop test”**
• No value added for buildings that cannot be lifted without
any pieces falling off
• $1,000 bonus for buildings that can be lifted
• $1,500 bonus for buildings that can be lifted and flipped
over
• $2,000 bonus for buildings that can be lifted, flipped over,
and dropped

**Aesthetics: the attractiveness of your building will be assessed according to the following criteria:**
• No value added for buildings that are a total eyesore
• $1,000 bonus for good use of color
• $1,500 bonus for good use of color and symmetry
• $2,000 bonus for a “work of art”

**Additional Rules:**
• The walls separating the individual stories of the house
must be least two (2) blocks high.
• Each story of the house must be completely enclosed by
a floor and a ceiling for it to count toward the point total. The
ceiling of one story can also be considered the floor of the
next story.
• The walls around the outside of the house must be two
knobs thick.
• There must be a cement foundation (a layer of white Lego
bricks) between the house and the ground, though it does not
need to be directly touching the ground. This should be the
same dimension as the first story of the house and can, but is
not required to, serve as the floor of the first story as well.
• There must be a solid layer of blue blocks between the top
of the house and the sky. This should be the same dimension
as the top story of the house and can, but is not required to,
serve as the roof of the house.

#### Garage

**Square footage (each “knob” is equal to one square foot):**
$20 per square foot
Quality: assessed using the “lift, flip, and drop test”
• No value added for buildings that cannot be lifted without
any pieces falling off
• $1,000 bonus for buildings that can be lifted
• $1,500 bonus for buildings that can be lifted and flipped
over
• $2,000 bonus for buildings that can be lifted, flipped over,
and dropped
**Aesthetics: the attractiveness of your building will be assessed according to the following criteria:**
• No value added for buildings that are a total eyesore
• $1,000 bonus for good use of color
• $1,500 bonus for good use of color and symmetry
• $2,000 bonus for a “work of art”
**Car spaces**: $2,000 for each individual parking space in the
garage
• Parking spaces must be completely enclosed and at least
20 square feet (e.g., exposed knobs) in size and have a door
opening that is at least 4 knobs wide and 2 blocks high to
qualify for this bonus.
**Additional Rules:**
• The walls of the garage can be either one knob or two
knobs thick.
• There must be a cement foundation (a layer of white Lego
bricks) between the garage and the ground, though it does not
need to be directly touching the ground. This can, but is not
required to, serve as the floor of the garage as well.
• There must be a solid layer of blue blocks between the top
of the garage and the sky. This should be the same dimension
as the top of the garage and can, but is not required to, serve
as the roof of the garage.
• The garage must be completely enclosed on the top, bottom, and sides, except for specified doors.

#### Pool
**Square footage** (each “knob” is equal to one square foot):
$50 per square foot
**Aesthetics**: the attractiveness of your pool will be assessed
according to the following criteria:
• No value added for pools that are a total eyesore
• $1,000 bonus for good use of color
• $1,500 bonus for good use of color and symmetry
• $2,000 bonus for a “work of art”
**Additional Rules:**
• There must be a diving board included.
• The floor of the pool must be blue.
• The walls around the edge of the pool should be only
one knob thick and three blocks high and should be one solid
color (of the designer’s choice) all the way around.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Points were calculated in dollar amount as shown above. 

## Incentives
> A $300 prize was offered to the team with the highest score at the end of the study. The points were calculated as shown above.
