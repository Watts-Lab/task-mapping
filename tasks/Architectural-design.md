# Stimuli
## The visual components
None provided, but videos and handouts shown to the participants can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W7pByMc7M1nKAEVNsp56huhRR7PwqHJ_?usp=sharing).


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were given written and video instructions of building task. 
2. The participants were given scoring information. The scoring was purposefully complex to encourage trade-offs. 
3. The room was video taped with the knowledge and consent of all participants.
4. After the video was shown, teams were given 10 minutes to work on a worksheet. The worksheet was used to decide tasks, rough-draft building structure, and a division of roles. 
5. Teams turned the worksheet in to the experimenter.
6. Teams were given 40 minutes to complete building task.
7. At 20 minutes, the team was told 20 minutes had passed.
8. At 35 minutes, the teams were told 5 minutes were remaining.


## Instructions

Participants were shown cost tables for each individual structure, bonuses for whether the building could be lifted, flipped over and/or dropped as well as rewards for the aesthetic appeal of the building.

Additionally there were rules governing the design of each building. The types of buildings were a house, garage and pool.
