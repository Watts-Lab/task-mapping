# Summary
Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma involves competition for a continuous public good, each player receives an endowment of e and has to decide whether or not to contribute his or her endowment. In IPD, group members were allowed to talk to eachother and to other groups before making payoff decisions. 
In IPD, a rational player should never contribute, regardless of what the other (in-group and out-group) members do, defection is the dominant individual strategy in the IPD game.

# Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
A second version of the experiment allowed for intergroup communication.  After receiving the game instructions and before making their decisions, subjects were allowed to discuss the situation with all other participants. Discussions were held in the central experimental room. Each discussion lasted exactly 5 min.


# Procedure
1. On their arrival at the laboratory, subjects were seated in a single room with arrangements to ensure their privacy. 
2. Each subject was handed a promissory note for IS 5, a copy of the payoff matrix summarizing the different ways to earn money in the experiment, and a group membership card assigning him to either the green or the red group (communication or no communication). Three subjects were assigned to each group.
3. After they were assigned to groups, subjects were told that they could each choose between keeping the IS 5 and investing the money,and they were given verbal instructions concerning the rules and payoffs of the game. 
4. The game instructions were neutral and were phrased in terms of Individual i's payoff as a function of his own decision to invest or not and the decisions made by the other players in his set. Subjects were not instructed to maximize their earnings, and no reference to cooperation or defection was made. 
5. Subjects were given a short quiz to test their understanding, and explanations were repeated until the experimenter was convinced that all subjects understood thepayoff matrix.
6. Subjects were told that to ensure the confidentiality of their decision they would make their decision in writing by checking the appropriate box on the decision form, receive their payment in sealed envelopes,and leave the laboratory one at a time with no opportunity to meet the other participants. 
7. At this stage, subjects in the no-communication condition made their decisions and subjects in the communication group were allowed to talk for five minutes before making decisions. 
8. Once all the decision forms were collected, subjects were handed a questionnaire in which they were asked to estimate (a)the probability that exactly 0, 1, or 2 of the remaining ingroup members contributed their endowment and (b) the probability that exactly 0,1, 2, or 3 outgroup members contributed their endowments.(The subjects were instructed that the probability estimates in eachquestion should sum to 1.) 
9. Following the completion of the question-naire, subjects were debriefed on the rationale and purpose of thestudy. They were then paid and dismissed individually

## Roles 
Group discussions were held in two separate rooms; an experimenter was present in each room and tape-recorded the discussion with the explicit knowledge and consent of the subject

# Criteria
Rates of Contribution: how much each group contributed 
Questionnaire Data: The probability estimates made by the subjects were used to compute the expected contribution proportion among the remaining ingroup members (denoted by p),and the expected contribution proportion among the outgroupmembers (denoted by q). 
Experiment Two: Compared Intergroup agreements and individual choice- number of contributors agreed on during the discussion and the actual number of contributors in each set

## Incentives
Subjects were paid between IS (Israli Shekels) 3 and IS 20 in the IPD conditionand between IS 0 and IS 23 in the IPG condition, contingent on their decisions and the decisions of the other members of their set.
