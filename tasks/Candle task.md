# Summary
The participants in this task are to choose the right object among many others to put three small candles side by side on a door at the height of the eyes. Experiment objects and other materials are organized in a setting with the pre-utilization of the right object and a setting without that. The goal of the experiment is to find out what determines whether and to what degree functional fixedness of an object hinders the finding of this object.

# Stimuli
## The visual components

The "box problem" (candle task): On the door, at the height of the eyes, three small candles are to be put side by side. 

1. In the setting for after pre-utilization of the crucial object (a.p.), there are three pasteboard boxes (about the size of an ordinary matchbox, differing somewhat in form and color and put in dfferent places) filled with experimental material: in one there were several thin little candles, tacks in another, and matches in the third.

2. In the setting without pre-utilization of the crucial object (w.p.), there are three empty pasteboard boxes.

There lay on the table - aside from the objects already mentioned - all kinds of material, partly less suitable partly completely unsuitable for the solution, such as paperclips, pieces of paper, string, pencils, tinfoil, old parts of apparatus, ashtrays, joints, pieces of wood. etc. The objects lay in apparent confusion, but in definite places. The crucial object never occupied a prominent place.

# Procedure
## Steps
Participants are given instructions on the use of the objects lay on the table to solve the problem and to think aloud during the experiment. One-half of the participants receive the problems in the settings: 1)w.p. 2)a.p. 3) w.p. 4) a.p. 5) w.p., and the other half of the participants received the opposite settings. (There are in total five problems in the experiment including the candle task) They then choose the objects to solve the problems.

## Roles 
Each participant completed the task following instructions.

## Instructions
The general instruction for all the problems ran in the experiment is as follows:

You will receive several little technical tasks. For solution, certain objects are needed which you will find among the objects here on the table is completely at your disposal. You may use what you like in any fashion you wish. Please think aloud during the experiment, so that I may hear as many of your ideas as possible, including those which you take less seriously.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Performance is evaluated in two ways:

(1) The solved and the unsolved problems were counted. A problem is counted as "solved" only when it was solved by use of the crucial object, which is always the best and simplest of the possible solutions. A problem is broken off as unsolved if for two to three minutes the subject produces no more proposals and his attitude has become so negative that no more sensible ideas seems forthcoming.

(2) The pre-solutions (proposals preceeding the solutions and different from it) are counted (only with those experiments where the correct solution is found) and the total time up to the final solution. Pre-solutions count not only those actually carried out, but also proposals merely formulated and those rejected as unsuitable. Objects that are merely touched or picked up quite briefly and silently laid aside again do not count as pre-solutions.

## Incentives
No incentives were mentioned for the experiment.
