<p><strong>These instructions appear during the course of the task:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>DO NOT REFRESH OR LEAVE THE PAGE! If you do, it may terminate the task for your team members and you will not be compensated.</li>
<li>You will receive the bonus pay at the stated hourly rate only if you<strong> fill out all survey questions and complete all rounds.</strong></li>
<li>The entire HIT will take no more than 45 minutes total.</li>
<li><strong>Task:</strong> You must evaluate competing requests for funding and make judgements about their relative merit. Many programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds. <br>Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support. <br>Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values.</li>
<li>You have <strong>$500,000 total to allocate</strong> from this fund. <br>Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make. The greater the contribution that you make to a particular project, the more likely it is that the chosen project will succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Proposed projects:</strong>

<ol>
<li>To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.</li>
<li>To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.</li>
<li>To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have 10 minutes to complete this decision as a group.<br>After everyone is done reading, begin discussing with your group members to agree on a final allocation. <strong>When prompted, enter the final choices and the reasons behind them.</strong><br>There is, of course, no optimal allocation. However, your group’s performance will be evaluated by judges based on how persuasive your arguments for the allocation are.</li>
<li><strong>You&#8217;re about half way through this round.</strong><br> As a reminder, you&#8217;re deciding on how to allocate $500,000 between the following initiatives based on which programs agree with your personal values:

<ol>
<li>To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.</li>
<li>To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.</li>
<li>To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.</li>
</ol></li>

<ol>
<li>To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.</li>
<li>To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.</li>
<li>To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.</strong></li>
</ol></li>
