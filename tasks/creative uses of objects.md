# Stimuli
## The visual components
From the Unusual Uses test found in the second source:

Participants are given only the name of an object and its common use- eg., a newspaper (for reading), and are given 6 blank lines to write down alternative uses.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
None.

# Procedure
## Steps
Participants are given a piece of paper with 3 common objects and their normal use. Each object has 6 blank lines underneath and particpants are asked to list alternative uses for each object within 5 minutes. 
This is repeated again, for a total of 6 objects.

## Roles 
None.

## Instructions
Complete instuctions not included, but quoted from "A Factor-Analytic Study of Evaluative Abilities": 

Each object has a common use which is given. The examinee is asked to list six other uses for which the object or parts of the object could serve* For example, given the item, ”a newspaper,” and its common use, ”for reading,”
one might think of the following other uses for a newspaper: (1) to start a fire, (2) to wrap garbage, (3) to
swat flies, (4) stuffing to pack boxes, (5) to line
drawers or shelves, (6) to make up a kidnap note. The
test is given in two separately-timed parts of five minutes each. Each part gives the names of three objects
and their common use with spaces for listing six other
uses per object.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Examinees are evalutated on the originality of their response, which is calculated through the "uncommonness of response method". Responses that were mentioned more frequently among the entire pool of examinees were weighed less than responses that were mentioned less frequently. 
Each alternative use listed could be scored from 0 (no response) to 5. 1/5 of the most infrequently mentioned responses had the highest score of 5, the next 1/5 of the most infrequently mentioned responses had a score of 4, and so on. 
## Incentives
No incentives.
