## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> There are 2 versions of the study. In version 1,  2 individuals were paired. In study 2, 6 participants were paired in a chain.

# Procedure
## Steps
> There are three difficulty levels. The three difficulty levels were characterized by
different proportions of correlated dots, pc = 50%, 30%, and 5%. In addition, the deviation was set to « = 0° in difficulty level 1 and to « = 45° in
difficulty levels 2 and 3.

## Roles 
> A description of roles if relevant to the task.  
> If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
> Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  
> Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  
> Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.

## Incentives
> A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   
> Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
