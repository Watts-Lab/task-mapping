# Summary
> This study examines the the role of collaboration in shaping corruption through a sequential dyadic dice-rolling game. In a incentive structure based on rolling doubles, players in the collaborative enviornment reported signficantly more doubles than when players played alone and when lying only benefited one party.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Step One: The general instructions, which were read out loud by an experimenter, informed participants that they will engage in a study composed of three stages. Each stage was explained separately once the previous stage was completed.

> Step Two: Participants learned that they will earn money based on their performance in each of the three stages. 

> Step Three: In the first stage, participants learned that they will engage in a die-rolling task in which the amount of money they will earn depends on the results of two die rolls. Following the general instructions, participants received on-screen treatment-specific information about the rules determining their payoff and had a few practice rounds to make sure they understood the payoffs associated with each roll. 

> Step Four: After indicating they understood rules, participants were paired up and played one period of die rolling task for payoff 

> Step Five: Participants were told that in the second stage they will engage in up to 30 additional periods with a different partner, and that they will be paid according to the results of one of these periods, which will be randomly selected. In reality there were always 20 additional periods and the participants payoff was varried based on experimental treatments (two person treatments vs. one person treatment) The payment incentives varied between treatments, with different inventives for A and B in a series of treatments.

> Step Six: Phase three focused o social value orientation through use of SVO slider. The measure assesses magnitude of people's concern to others' outcomes. Participants made a series of 15 choices between 9 resource allocation opporunities between self and another participant

## Instructions
Phase One Instructions
1.1 Instructions: 
The instructions consisted printed pages and on-screen instructions. Each participant received a copy of the printed instructions, and these were read out loud by an experimenter. The printed instructions were the same for all participants. Treatments differed only in the onscreen instructions, which complemented the printed pages and explained the specific details relevant to each treatment. The instructions below are English translations of the German instructions used in the experiment.

General instructions (printed)

Welcome and thank you for participating in this experiment. Please remain quiet and switch off your mobile phone. Do not speak to the other participants. Communication between participants will lead to the automatic end of the session with no payment to anyone.
Whenever you have a question, please raise your hand and one of the experimenters will
come to your cubicle. Please read the instructions carefully. The instructions are the same for all participants. You will receive €2.50 for having shown up on time. The experiment allows you to earn additional money. The experiment consists of exactly three phases. The instructions for each
phase will be explained after the previous phase is finished. The three phases are independent, i.e., the decisions you and the other participants make in one phase do not influence the other phases in any way.

Instructions for single trial die-rolling task (printed)

Instructions for the first phase
In this phase your payoff depends on luck, and will be determined by die rolls. You will roll the die, report the result on the computer, and your payoff will be determined according to rules that will be explained on-screen.

How to roll?

On your desk you have a covered cup with a six-sided die. To roll, hold the cup in your hand,
shake a few times, and place the cup on your desk. Then peek through the hole, and report the
result. Try this once or twice now – roll the die and peek through the hole. [At this point the
experimenter reading the instructions paused to allow participants to try rolling the dice.]

Payoff

The amount of money you will earn in this phase depends on the result of two rolls. Some of you will roll twice; others will be paired with another participant, and each member of the pair will roll once. You will receive information about the order of rolling (who rolls first,
who rolls second) on-screen, as well as the rules by which payoffs are determined.

Understanding the rules

The payoff-rules will be presented on-screen in a table which details the result of the first roll, the result of the second roll, and the associated payoffs. In most cases payoffs are higher when the two rolls are identical and lower when the two rolls differ. Now you can see the
table on your screen [See 1.1.3 for a screen shot].

Please follow the on-screen instructions. Try as many practice rolls as you like, until you are sure that the die is fair and that you understand how the two rolls determine your payoff, and possibly the payoff of another
person. You can also fill-in hypothetical numbers without rolling, to fully understand the table [See 1.1.4 for screen shots].

Once you have understood the rules, and are convinced that the die is fair, click “I Understand the Rules / Die is fair” on your screen. [At this point the experimenter reading the instructions paused until all participants indicated they have understood the rules and are convinced that the die is fair.]

Rolling for payoff

The rolls that will determine the payoff in this stage will take place in a moment. Please follow the instructions on your screen precisely [See 1.1.5 for the on-screen instructions participants saw at this point].

Phase Two Instructions:

There were no written Instructions for this phase.The following message appeared on-screen, and was also read out loud by the experimenter:
Phase 2 is identical to Phase 1 except that the interaction will take place multiple times (not more than 30). The procedure and the rules are exactly as in phase 1. The other person (person X) you will be matched with in Phase 2 is not the person you were matched with in Phase 1. You will be matched with a different person who will remain the same for all periods of Phase 2. At the end of Phase 2 one period will be selected randomly and you will be paid according that period.

Instructions for Social Value Orientation task (printed)

Before reading these instructions, there was a message on-screen indicating that 30 “Experimental currency Units” (ECU) are worth €1.

Phase Three Instruction:

In this phase you will make a series of decisions about allocating resources (ECU) between yourself and another person. For each of the following items, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by clicking the respective position. There are no 'right or wrong' answers, this is all about personal preferences. In the example below, a person has chosen to distribute the resources so that he/she receives 85 ECU, while the other person receives 75 ECU. After all participants have made their decisions you will be randomly assigned to be an “Allocator” or a “Recipient”. If you are an allocator then one of your decisions (randomly chosen) will determine your payoff and the payoff of another participant. If you are a
recipient then your payoff will be determined by one of the other participants.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> The amount of double reported across treatment conditions served as the measure for corrupt behavior. Researchers looked at the mean number of reported double in comparison to the honesty baseline in all treatments. 

## Incentives
Incentives were based on rolling outcomes and corruption, the rules were as follows: 
> In the main aligned outcomes treatment, if both A and B reported the same number, each earned that number in euros (i.e., if both
reported 1, each earns V1; if both reported 2, each earns V2; etc.). 

> In the cases they reported different numbers, they earned nothing. In six control treatments the payoff of either A or B was varied. 
In treatment A-high (B-high) A(B) earned V6 if a double was reported (regardless of the value of the double), whereas B (A) earned the value of the double as in aligned outcomes. 

> In treatment A-low, A (B) earned V1 if a double was reported (regardless of the value of the double), whereas B (A) earned the value of the double as in aligned outcomes. 

> In treatment A-fixed (B-fixed), A (B) earned a fixed V1 in each period, regardless of whether a double was reported or not, whereas B (A) earned the value of the double as in aligned outcomes. 

> In an individual treatment, the same person rolled and reported twice and earned the value of the double if a double was reported, nothing otherwise
