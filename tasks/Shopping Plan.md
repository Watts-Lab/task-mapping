## The visual components

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 


# Procedure
## Steps
>The group had to plan a shopping trip as though they were all residents of the same house sharing the same car. Each member had a grocery list and the group was given a map that showed distances and times between each store.
>The group had to decide how to get the items on their list while considering the constraints like some stores having cheaper and higher quality options requiring more driving time.
>The point values were assigned to grocery items based on (a) each item purchased = +1 point, (b) bonus for high quality item = +1 point, (c) bonus for lower priced alternative = +2 points, (d) penalty for leaving frozen items in the car beyond 30 minutes = loss of all points for that item
> The goal was to purchase as many high-quality items as possible, therefore aiming for the highest number of points.

## Rolls 
> Each individual had the same role as residents of the same house sharing the same car.

## Instructions
> No further instructions were provided other than what was listed in the procedure.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Performance was evaluated based on the number of points the group obtained.

## Incentives
