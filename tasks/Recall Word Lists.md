# Summary
Participants recalled word lists in two sessions, in session one, they recalled words presented by an audio player independently. In session two they were assigned to pairs or worked as indivduals to recall the materials.

Word Lists presented based on: https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1995-42833-001

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Each list was recorded on audio tape by a male voice at the rate of one word per second. An auditory cue recall was also recorded after the last word of each list so that the participants had to write down the words immediately.


# Procedure
## Steps
The experiment consisted of two successive sessions. 
1. In the first session, participants were tested in groups of 2 to 10 people. They were told to remember the lists of words which would be presented by an audio tape player and write the last word first and then to recall the remainder in any order. 
2. After each list the participants were given 2 minutes for an immediate written free recall.
3. In the second session, after the fifth immediate free recall test, participants were given another unexpected written free recall test. Each participant was assigned either to one of the 33 pairs or as one of the 66 individuals who recalled the material by themselves.
4.  To avoid environmental context-dependent effects (cf. Smith, Glenberg, &
Bjork, 1978), they were escorted by the experimenter to separate small rooms to recall the words either individually or collaboratively. 
5. Participants in the individual recall groups were asked to write down all the words they could remember. Each pair of
participants was given a sheet of paper, and one person was asked to volunteer to be the scribe. They were required to recall the material collaboratively, and to complete one recall sheet. No time limit was required to complete the final free recall test which typically took less than 20 minutes

## Roles
In the groups of two, one person served as the scribe writing down all the words that the grop could remember. 

## Instructions
Participants were asked to write down all the words they can remember. Later experiments modified groups to be either friends or non-friends (experiment 2), and then modified word number of recall tests (experiment 3).

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The individual recall data were computed for the total number of correct and false recalls for each individual.

The nominal pairs in the final test were formed from random combinations of participants who recalled the words by themselves. The correct and false recalls of the nominal pairs were obtained by combining each individual recall and allowing for any redundant items that appeared in both.

## Incentives
Participants either recieved partial course credit or volunteered to participate.
