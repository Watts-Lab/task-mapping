# Procedure
## Steps
Based on Paper One: 
1. Participants were assigned randomly to groups and to aliases and were introduced to their fellow group members. The experimenter explained the general purpose of the experiment and explained that groups in the study would participate in a $30 lottery for each task. Chances in the lottery were based on the quantity and quality of performance. Participants then signed consent forms. 
Participants in both media conditions were informed that the group discussions would be recorded. 
> Groups in the CM condition were given a brief training session on the use of the computer conferencing system. The CM sessions were conducted in a laboratory consisting of 16 personal computers. Participants were seated so that two group members sat in adjoining carrels and the third sat in a carrel across from them with his or her back to the other two members. Eye contactwas restricted by dividers between computers. Participants were told to refrain from talking to each other during the experiment. The CM groups communicated via a synchronous computer conferencing system in which users type and send messages to a “common message board” that appears on all three users’ screens. Messages are identified by an alias (participant A, B, or C), although members knew who was assigned to each code. Transcripts of the groups’discussions were saved by the computer system.
> Participants in FTF groups were asked to speak, in turn, so that their voices could be distinguished on the tape; they stated the same message that was typed by participants in the CMtraining session. The FTF discussions were audiotaped and transcribed.
2. Groups performed each of three tasks selected to represent increasing levels of interdependence: an idea generation task, an intellective task, and a judgment task- the focus here. Twelve minutes were allotted for each task session
3. In the judgment task,groups decided on disciplinary actions in a fictitious, controversial case in which a college basketball player bribed an instructor to change his grade on an exam, to maintain his eligibility on the team. 
> The task was to agree on one choice from a list of alternatives for each of five issues having to do with the treatment of the athlete and the instructor. In addition, groups were told to satisfy conflicting interests of the faculty, college administration, and athletic department when making their decisions.
4. After completing each task, participants individually filled out questionnaires. They received a written debriefing after the final task session.


## Instructions
Instructions written by CSS Lab and based on Paper One: 

General Introduction: 
Thank you for participating in our experiment today. We are looking to understand group work and consensus building in a series of tasks today. The groups in the study are participating in a $30 lottery for each task. Your chances in the lottery were based on the quantity and quality of performance. 

Your group must decide on a disciplinary action in a fictitious, controversial case in which a college basketball player bribed an instructor to change his grade on an exam, to maintain his eligibility on the team. You must agree on a choice for the following issues
1. Student's Grade 
2. Student Suspension 
3. Student's Basketball Team
4. Instructor Punishment 
5. Instructor Future Position 

Each has to do with the treatment of the athlete and the instructor. Please make sure to satisfy conflicting interests of the faculty, college administration, and athletic department when making your decisions. Once you have agreed on your choices, please fill out a form indicating your choices. 

Additional Instructions based on Paper One: 
CM Group: 
You will be communicating with your fellow group members via a computer mediated communication system in which you can type and send messages to a “common message board” that appears on all three users’ screens. Messages are identified by an alias (participant A, B, or C), and you will know who was assigned to each code.You will need to refrain from talking to each other during the experiment.

FTF Group: 
You will be communicating face-to-face and directly with your group members. Before we get started, can you please state the following message so we can record and distinguish your voice: "It looks like it may rain later, I'm glad I have my umbrella with me" 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Responses were scored using a rubric that reflected the degree to which the groups considered the balance of competing perspectives on the problem.

## Incentives

Paper One: Students received credit toward a research participation requirement for taking part in the study

Paper Two: All participants were paid for their participation.
