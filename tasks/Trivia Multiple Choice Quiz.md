# Summary
> Participants were organized into groups of four and performed a series of tasks in a series of rounds with old and new group members. 

Tasks were creative, intellective and cognitive conflict tasks. 

Creative Task: collaborators wrote a short online text advertisements for product campaigns for Kickstarter, teams decided on a final ad and one member submits on behalf of the team 

Intellective task: participants were asked to correctly answer a series of questions without looking up the solutions online, instead debating with their group members on what the answers to the questions could be. At the end teams decided on the correct answer for each prompt and one person submitted a list on behalf of the team 

Cognitive Conflict Task: teams were given $500,000 and had to allocate funds between a number of competing programs which were each designed to appeal to particular personal values

# Procedure
## Steps
> 1. Participants assigned to task group- the teams were allocated based on social golfer matching, so that each collaboration
consists of members who have never interacted before
> 2. Participants play four rounds of that task (order balanced across groups: 2 with same group, two with new group) 
> 3. At the end of each round participants complete a viability scal
> 4. At the end of all rounds participants attitudinal data collected 


## Instructions
> Need to check with researchers

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Team fracture: 
> Associated with low average team viability scores:  at the end of each round, each participant filled out a 14-item viability scale drawn from prior work

> Attitudinal data: when at least half of a group’s members privately excluded that group from future rounds

Relationship between fracture & performance: Task performance in the creative and intellective tasks
> Creative: Google Ad words Click Through Rate 

> Intellective: percent difference each teams answers were from the correct answer, and recorded the median of these values for each team interaction

## Incentives
Participants were paid $12 per hour for taking part in the experiment, and were incentivized to complete the entire study by receiving a majority of their payment as a bonus at the end of the experiment.
