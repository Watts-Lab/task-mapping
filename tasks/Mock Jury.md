# Summary
The experiment performed was designed to test the effects of group deliberation on jurors when exposed to inadmissable evidence. Speciffically the study sought to see how group deliberation would effect jurors individual ability to disregard inadmissable evidence.
In the experiment, mock jurors were exposed to highly incriminating evidence that was ruled inadmissable because of due process concerns.  After reading the case and receiving jury instructions, jurors completed a brief predeliberation questionnaire, rendering their individual verdict(guilty or not guilty) and their verdict confidence(from 0% to 100% confident).

# Procedure
## Steps
All participants will act as jurors.
1) Jurors are split into groups ranging in size of 8-12. (Average group size should be around 10)
  - After the groups are created,each group is given one of three possible versions of the mock trial script.  All versions of the script should contain testimonies from both the defense and prosectuion.  The only difference in the versions of the script is the extra admissable/inadmissable evidence. The three versions can be described as follows.
    - Control group script, which is the base script, containing the mock trial
    - Admissable group script, the same script as the control group, containing an extra piece of evidence that the group is allowed to use in their decision making
    - Inadmissible group script, the same script as the control group, containing the same extra piece of evidence as to the Admissable group, however, this group is told the extra evidence is inadmissible
3) Each person is to read the trial and act as a juror, they then fill out a pre-deliberation questionaire, where they are asked their personal verdict(guilty or not guilty) and their confidence in their decision(from0 to 100%).  They then deliberate with their group and the goal is to reach a unanimous verdict, if they cannot rreach this within an hour they are cut off.  They then fill out a post-deliberation questionaire where they are once again asked about their individual verdict and confidence in their decision.

## Roles 
Jurors
- All participants act as jurors on a regular jury

## Instructions
All groups are to act as juries.  Juries with the inadmissable evidence are supposed to not let that information bias them.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Not addressed within the paper, the focus of the experiment was to test the effects of group deliberation on each jurors specific bias stemming from inadmissable evidence.

Perceptions of Guilt: Participants filled in pre and post-deliberation questionnaires, regarding their perceptions of the defendants guilt, and their confidence in their verdict.  
Guilt Score: 9-point grading scale.  Ranging from 1(definitely not guilty) to 9(definitely guilty).  This scale was to rank the degree to which they thought the defendant was culpable, regardless of their verdict.  
Confidence Scale: Participants indicated on a 9-point scale the degree of confidence they had in their verdict.  The scale ranged from, 1(not at all) to 9(very confident).  
Culpability Score: Participants in the inadmissable condition also ranked thei predicted estimate of how guilty they would have percieved the defendant if the critical evidence was not presented.  This was also ranked on a 9-point scale.

If the time limit was reached, and no verdict was reached by the jury, the experiment ended in a hung jury.

## Incentives
Participants in the experiment were incentivised with partial credit for a class.
