# Procedure
## Steps
All participants will act as jurors.
1) Jurors are split into groups ranging in size of 8-12. (Average group size should be around 10)
2) The groups are presented with a script from a mock trial.  
  - Some of the groups are given the "regular" trial, with no extra admissable or inadmissable evidence, these are the control groups.
  - Other groups are presented are given a version of the trial that has extra admissable evidence.
  - The last groups are given a version of the trail with the same extra evidence, but they are told is is inadmissable and must be ignored, but not told why it is inadmissable.
3) Each person is to read the trial and act as a juror, they then fill out a pre-deliberation questionaire, where they are asked their personal verdict(guilty or not guilty) and their confidence in their decision(from0 to 100%).  They then deliberate with their group and the goal is to reach a unanimous verdict, if they cannot rreach this within an hour they are cut off.  They then fill out a post-deliberation questionaire where they are once again asked about their individual verdict and confidence in their decision.
