# Stimuli
## The visual components
> No visual components besides given materials: coins, bills, etc. and private receptacle to place money inside.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> Multiple rounds: Same materials as the original version, but multiple rounds are played instead of one.
> 
> Transparent version: A see-through box can be used so participants know how much the previous player put in. Alternatively, players can be told how much the previous players put in.
> 
> Punishment/awards: A player can choose to punish "free-riders", i.e. those who don't contribute any money, by imposing a fine. Conversely, a player may choose to reward the highest contributer(s). Punishments and rewards are taken out of the player's own tokens.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Players receive tokens.
> 
> One by one, players place as many or as little tokens as they wish into a private box. Players keep any tokens they did not give.
> 
> Tokens are counted up and multiplied by some factor, then divided equally between the players.
> 
> (The game can also be played on a computer program, doesn't need to have physical tokens and boxes.)

## Roles 
> No roles.

## Instructions
> See Steps.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Participants are evaluated by how many tokens they each give to the public pool.

## Incentives
> Participants do not receive incentives to participate.
