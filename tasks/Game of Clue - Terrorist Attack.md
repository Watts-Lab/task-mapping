# Summary
Participants played a 'who-done-it' game like Clue or Cluedo in wich the task involved piecing together clues, or facts to connect the dots. Specifically, participants were faced with four logically independent subproblems to solve: (a) who would carry out the attack (group involved), (b) what would be the target (e.g., an embassy or a church), (c) where the attack would take place (country), and (d) when the attack would take place (with four interdependent components—month, day, hour, and time of day (a.m. versus p.m.)).

# Procedure
## Steps
1. The experiment was carried out in a laboratory setting, with each participant seated at a computer in a private carrel. Each experimental run lasted 25 minutes. Each experimental session began with an instructional video explaining the platform and the task in uniform fashion to every subject across all sessions. To control for individual aptitude, each person then took a pretest with the same format as the experimental task, with a similar but smaller-scale problem and without interaction with other participants.
> There were four 16-person network treatments
    Caveman (CAVE): contained four four-person cliques
    Hierarchy (HIER): four four-person cliques arranged in a conventional centralized structure
    Rewired Caveman (RCAVE): removed links from the caveman network, then added links that created shortcuts through the network
    Ring (RING): a network that was neither clustered nor centralized
2. Subjects could take part in up to three runs of the experiment. Within any given run, all subjects had the same level of experience with the experiment. That is, if a subject were taking part in a second run, then all of the other subjects in that run would also be taking part for the second time. Holding this experience constant eliminated the possibility of spurious correlations between learning and network structure. In the multivariate analyses, we include a round variable that indicates the experience of the participants in number of runs through the experiment.
> Before each run began, a network treatment was chosen at random and study subjects were randomly assigned to a position in that network that was uncorrelated to their physical location in the laboratory. Participants were assigned a pseudonym to further obscure their identities from each other; the pseudonyms were shuffled before each round.
4. Participants were given two clues at the start of each round and were allowed to search for more clues once per minute. They could share clues they had one at a time with one or more of their neighbors, and could add free-text annotations to these shared clues
5. The initial distribution of clues was not correlated with outcomes. Each clue was only relevant to one subproblem. Some clues contained useless or misleading information. 
6. Subjects had to combine multiple clues to conclusively arrive at the correct answer. The number of clues necessary to solve a single subproblem ranged from 2 to 10, with a median of 5 and a mean of 5.3. Each participant typed their solution into the separate spaces given for each subproblem, and could check their neighbors solutions at any time and any number of times


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Exploration in information space at the collective level with two variables: the number of unique facts discovered by the group as a whole and the ratio of total facts found to unique facts found. The latter measure can be interpreted as the degree to which facts were found multiple times within the same group, or simply as the redundancy of facts found. The more unique facts and the lower the redundancy, the greater the exploration of information space.

Exploration in information space Individual Level: Total number of facts found by (a) the subject’s own search (the search interface did not return facts that an individual already possessed, so the total number of facts represented the extent of exploration in information space by search) and (b) the redundancy of facts received from neighbors (the ratio of total facts received to unique facts received)

Exploration and Exploitation in Solution Space: total number of unique theories that were registered during the experiment

Performance was measured in pay per minute received by individuals. When measuring the performance of an entire network, we simply added up all the members’ pay per minute.

## Incentives
Participants were rewarded 15¢ per minute per subproblem (3.75¢ per minute for each component of “when”) for which they had a correct answer registered, for a maximum of 60¢ for each minute (equivalent to $36 dollars per hour).
