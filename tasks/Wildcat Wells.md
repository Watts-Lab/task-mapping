# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are recruited on online platform (mTurk).
2. Once arriving participants accept the HIT, they are directed to a screen informing them that the experiment had not yet filled, along with how many remaining players were required. Once all positions are filled, participants in the waiting room are informed that the game is about to commence.
3. Before the start of each game, all players were randomly assigned to unique positions in one of eight network topologies, where each player’s
collaborators for that game were his or her immediate neighbors in that network.
4. Each player would see (a) the full landscape to be explored; (b) his or her own current and previous locations; (c) the scores corresponding to those locations; and (d) the previous locations and corresponding scores of his or her three assigned collaborators (i.e., network neighbors), whose locations are made visible. 
5. On each turn, all players can choose any of the 100 × 100 grid squares as their next location to “drill.” If the player hovers over one of the drill locations, the exact score appears and the corresponding bar in the player’s (or neighbor’s) history would be highlighted. Similarly, hovering over a bar in the history would show the points and the corresponding location on the landscape.
6. Players had to select and submit a location to drill within some amount of time; in the first 2 rounds of the game, they had 60 seconds to make their decision, and in the remaining 13 rounds, they had 30 seconds. If they did not submit a location in that time, the round was skipped and they earned no points for that round.
7. The total number of points the players have accumulated is always displayed to them. At the end of the 15 rounds, they are shown a summary of the game as well as the total number of points they earned before advancing to the next game.
8. In all, they played eight games, one for each network topology, which typically took a total of 50–60 min.


## Instructions
In a few moments, you will see a large lot of land. Under the sand, there may be oil reservoirs. Some reservoirs are deeper or wider than others. You will not know where reservoirs lie just by looking at the sand. The only way to find oil is by drilling, and you will have 25 opportunities to drill. Your success in finding oil will determine your total score.

When each round begins, choose a spot for drilling by clicking somewhere on the sandy landscape. Click "drill" within 20 seconds. Then, you will see the amount of oil you found. The amount is indicated by a colored square and a corresponding bar on the left side of the screen. The higher the bar, the better your performance.

After you have chosen a drilling spot or 20 seconds have passed, you will advance to the next round. If 20 seconds have passed and you have not made a drilling decision, then you will find nothing in that round.

The only way to find oil is by drilling, and you will have 25 opportunities to drill. You may drill once in each of the 25 rounds.

Before you begin the game, please answer the following questions.

In this game, you're drilling for 
--select--

How many seconds do you have to make a decision? 
--select--

The game advances to the next round after
 you move your cursor at all
 you find the maximum amount of oil
 you chose a drilling point or 20 seconds have passed
 at least 10 seconds have passed
Which of these statements is true?
 The location and size of oil reservoirs is fixed throughout the game.
 The location of oil reservoirs is fixed but the size may change during the game.
 The size of oil reservoirs is fixed but the location may change during the game.
 The size and location of oil reservoirs may change during the game.
 The size and location of oil reservoirs can be deduced from the color of the sand.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Players were incentivized to drill and earn points, and for each game, the participants were paid according to the points that they earned across all eight games in each session at a rate of $0.00075 per point.

## Incentives
Participants were paid based on their performance and total points earned. Hence, they were motivated to maximize their individual scores but had no incentive to deceive others.
