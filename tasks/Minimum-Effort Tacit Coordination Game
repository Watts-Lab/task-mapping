# Summary
> Players are provided different equilibrium points that are pareto ranked and need to make a payoff decision that reaches a efficient equibilibrium point with uncertainty testing payoff dominance.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> There were three variations of the experiment that were used in seven experiments- see the payoff table image below: 

Treatment A and A': the following values were assigned to the parameters in equation (1): parameter a was set equal to $0.20, parameter b was set equal to $0.10,and a  constant of $0.60 was added to ensure that all payoffs were strictly positive. Consequently, the payoff-dominant equilibrium, (7, ... , 7), paid $1.30 while the secure equilibrium, (1,...,1), paid $0.70 per subject per period. This period treatment was repeated ten times and the number of players varied between 14-16 subjects

Treatment B: In treatment B, parameter b in equation (1) was set equal to zero, see payoff Table B. This gives the subjects a dominating strategy (play 7 regardless of the minimum), which eliminates the coordination problem

Treatment C: In treatment C, group size was reduced to two people who were strangers


# Procedure
## Steps
> 1. Subjects were read the instructions and no preplay or negotiation was allowed. Design parameters were altered resulting in a sequence of treatments labeled A, B, A'and C
> 2. Subjects were given the information about their payment parameters and a payoff table 
> 3. Subjects filled out a questionnaire to determine that they understood how to read the payoff table for treatment A, that is, map actions into money  payoff
> 4. After each repetition of the period game (which changed depending on treatment), the minimum  action was publicly announced and the subjects calculated their earnings for that period
> 5. Instructions for continuation treatments were given to the subjects after earlier treatments had been completed
> 6. Occasionally, subjects were asked to predict the actions of all the subjects in the treatment


## Instructions
> Authors no longer have instructions 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Performance was based on the payoff amount that participants gave and their earnings. 

## Incentives
>  Particpants could keep what they earned at each round. The largest payoff in period one was $1.00 and some payoffs were $0.10. (The payoff-dominant equilibrium would have paid everyone $1.30. Additionally a subject was paid $0.70 less 0.02 times the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the actual and predicted actions.
