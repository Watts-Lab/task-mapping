# Summary
A high level summary that presents the main idea of the task.

separate the rational (the use of technical knowledge in the allocation of means to the efficient attainment of end) and legal (the normative order which regulates relations among incumbents of a graded system of office)

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations. 

If no visual components are provided or seem not to be needed describe an interface for executing this task in an online environment with remote participants. 

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
The sequence of the experiment was completed in three days during the Easter vacation to reduce contamination from subjects interaction and divided into three time periods.

During t0, three coders at a time received instructions from a project director about coding and rules of organization. During this 30-minute instruction period each subject practiced coding and was given a code book, code sheets, and time sheets to keep record of work. Three coders were then taken to separate room and instructed to work independentlty.
Each subject practiced coding, give
During t1, coders met supervisors for 45 minutes.
During t2, supervisor called coder to tell that he had to leave and assig a new supervisor. Supervisors were rotated to control for variations in their personalities. Meanwhile, a messenger brought questionnaires and coders started working after 45 minuted ellapsed respresentatives of .. came and asked questions.


A task flow describing the stages a participant goes through and a formal specification of any conditional or complex relationships therein. 

List the steps that make up the task. This could include a training protocol, pre and post surveys, task rounds, etc.  

Describe the relationship between the steps. By default they are assumed to be chronological and have no interdependencies, but if they are not chronological, e.g., a choice changes the order of the steps, that should be described in full detail. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent, e.g., performance on one step influences what is seen on another step, this should be described in full detail.

An experiment was completed in three days during vacation so that subjects could not discuss the experiment until it was over and they returned to school.

## Roles
Coders: College students were hired who believed it was a real job of coding the face sheet of a nationally distributed questionnaire 
Research subjects
Coding supervisors: Confederates of experimenters were randmoly assigned to a coder and were randomly assigned to treat a coder 
Responsible for decisions of coding problems that were not in the code book Communicated with coders through telephone calls Were given a standard set of responses to each trap and a set of instructions for other calls
Gave administrative orders, common to all treatments, concerning the code and time sheets.
Project director: Experimenters who instructed coders
Representatives of management research organizations: interviewers


## Instructions
Experimenters instructed sujects on coding and rules of organization during t0. A part of introductory statement about organization read:

"National Social Surveys, Inc. is a non-profit research organization sponsored by several universities. It is dedicated to the discovery of scientific knowledge about human behavior, principally through the use of sample surveys. To realize this objective, it takes great pains to recruit personnel who will conduct research of the highest caliber. All personnel of the organization, whether directors of projects, coding supervisors, or coders, are expected to perform their work in accordance with traditional scientific standards of objectivity, accuracy, and integrity. Imagination as well as meticulousness are requirements of scientific research. As a coder for National Social Surveys, you perform operations which are of critical importance for the conduct of a research project. Errors in coding diminish the validity of the data which have been collected with great care and at a great cost. To avoid errors, please read the following coding and operating instructions carefully."

The experimenter stressed calling supervisor in case of difficulty. Each subject received instructions to work independetly to increase efficiency, which was done to eliminate interactions among subjects during the experiment.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Perfomance of subordinates
Beliefs of subordinates regarding the legitimacy of their superior's authority
Conformity of subordinates to the rules of organization and commands of superiors (organizational problem)
Independent variable of treating 

A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  

Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  

This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured.
The results confirmed the relationship between the independent variable and conformity.

We expect all three variables to be negatively affected by office without knowledge, and we expect legitimacy the willingness of subordinates to accept the authority of their superiors as valid-to play the role of an intervening variable. We also hypothesize that subordinates will discrim inate among the commands of their superiors, considering some of these actions to be primarily administrative and others to be primarily technical. The negative effects of office without knowledge should be confined to the latter.


## Incentives
Each participant was paid $1.25 per hour.
