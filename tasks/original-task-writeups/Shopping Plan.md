# Summary
Individuals were assigned a number of tasks to complete alone and with a group to determine if there is a level of intelligence among groups as there is in an individual.

# Procedure
## Steps
Step one: Before meeting their teams, participants were given 10 minutes to complete half of the 36-item Raven’s II test (all of the odd-numbered items)

Each item presents a 3 x 3 array (or “matrix”) of shapes with the lower-right corner empty. Based on patterns in the sequences of shapes, subjects must pick which of 8 other shapes properly belongs in the empty space. 

Step two: The group had to plan a shopping trip as though they were all residents of the same house sharing the same car. Each member had a grocery list and the group was given a map that showed distances and times between each store.

Step three: The group had to decide how to get the items on their list while considering the constraints like some stores having cheaper and higher quality options requiring more driving time.

Step four: The point values were assigned to grocery items based on (a) each item purchased = +1 point, (b) bonus for high quality item = +1 point, (c) bonus for lower priced alternative = +2 points, (d) penalty for leaving frozen items in the car beyond 30 minutes = loss of all points for that item

Step five: The team had to purchase as many high-quality items as possible, therefore aiming for the highest number of points.

Step six: As a criterion task at the end of each session, each group played checkers against a standardized computer opponent.

Members were first familiarized with the game and the rules individually and given 5 minutes to talk about their strategy.

Teams then played a practice match and then one test match against the computer opponent. Only the results of the test match were used for the analysis.

Teams received one point for each move they made, two points for each piece captured, and 3 points for each king they earned.

## Roles 
Each individual had the same role as residents of the same house sharing the same car.

## Instructions
No further instructions were provided other than what was listed in the procedure.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance was evaluated based on the number of points the group obtained.

## Incentives
All participants were paid for their participation.
