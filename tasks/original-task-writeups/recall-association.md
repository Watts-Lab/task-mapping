# Summary

This study was designed to understand collaborative inhibition causes. Researchers compare individual recall (control) to two collaborative group conditions, 
one in which people took turns recalling items together (called the See Group) and the other in which people take turns recalling items but are not aware of the items their partner has recalled (No See Group). Findings how that collaborative inhibition is due to interference caused by the product of recall- sharing answers with each other, not the process of taking turns without sharing.

# Procedure
## Steps

Step One: Assign participants to one of three conditions 

Step Two: Show participants booklet with list of words and give them time to study words The participants were instructed to start on the first
page, study the presented word for 4 sec, turn the page, study the second word, and so on until all the words had been studied. 

Step Three: Participants complete addition tasks to reduce recency effects 

Step Four: Participants enter recall task based on assigned group  

Nominal Condition: Participants would work alone to recall words and were tested individually 

Collaborative Group See Condition: participants worked in pairs and took turns recalling words and were showed the words that each other were recalling. They sat opposite each other at a table 

Collaborative Group No See Condition: participants recalled word lists in pairs, using a turn-taking method however they did not see what words the other person recalled
     
## Roles 

Participants worked in collaborative or non-collaborative roles, completing an individual recall survey afterward

## Instructions
> Instructions written by CSS Lab

Thank you for participating in our experiment today. You will be given a booklet of words and given time to study these words. You will be testd on the words and you cannot talk to eachother or write anything down during the study period. 

Please work on the following addition problems. (NEED TO DEVELOP TASK)

Nominal Condition: 
Please write down as many items as you can remember from the word lists. You will see some list names (bread, man, music, and sleep) are provided at the top of the recall sheet. You can recall the studied items in any order, starting with any of the lists, and you can switch between lists. There is no time limit for recalling the studied items, but the recall period will end if you fail to recall an additional word within 30 sec. 

See Condition: 
You will be working in pairs to write down as many items as you can from the word lists, you will share a single answer sheet. You will see some list names (bread, man, music, and sleep) are provided at the top of the recall sheet. One member of your team will begin by writing down one of the items, you must then pass the sheet to your partner and they will write down the next item. You should not write down a word that has been recalled by your partner. 

This turn-taking procedure will be repeated until 1 person fails to recall a new item within 10 sec. The recall sheet will then be handed back to your partner. If they fail to recall another item within 10 sec for the third time, they will be excluded from further recall, and you will be given the chance to recall the remaining items.

No See Condition: 
You will be working in pairs to write down as many items as you can from the word lists, you will have individual answer sheets. You will see some list names (bread, man, music, and sleep) are provided at the top of the recall sheet. One member of your team will begin by writing down one of the items, you must then tell your partner to begin. You cannot discuss the items with each other.  

This turn-taking procedure will be repeated until 1 person fails to recall a new item within 10 sec. Your partner can then start to fill out their sheet.  If they fail to recall another item within 10 sec for the third time, they will be excluded from further recall, and you will be given the chance to recall the remaining items

Final Recall: 

You will now work independently on recalling list items. Please fill out the answer sheet with as many words as you can remember in any order. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Performance of each group is determined by number of words recalled correctly on recall sheet 

## Incentives

There were no incentives for the project. All participants were volunteers.
