# Summary

Participants were asked to correctly answer a series of questions without looking up the solutions online, instead debating with their group members on what the answers to the questions could be. Prompts included estimating the number of states that border the Gulf of Mexico, the percentage of the U.S. population that goes online at least once a week, and the height in feet of Mount McKinley. At the end of each round, the team collectively decided on their final answers and one member submitted a final list of answers on behalf of the team.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants assigned to task group- the teams were allocated based on social golfer matching, so that each collaboration consists of members who have never interacted before
2. Participants play four rounds of that task (order balanced across groups: 2 with same group, two with new group)
3. At the end of each round participants complete a viability scale
4. At the end of all rounds participants attitudinal data collected

## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
1. DO NOT REFRESH OR LEAVE THE PAGE! If you do, it may terminate the task for your team members and you will not be compensated.
These instructions appear during the course of the task:
2. You will receive the bonus pay at the stated hourly rate only if you fill out all survey questions and complete all rounds.
3. The entire HIT will take no more than 45 minutes total.

Please do NOT use any external resources (e.g. internet, books, friends, etc.) besides whoever is in your chatroom. Your answers will NOT impact your bonus, however, if we suspect that external sources were used to answer the questions, we will reject the work.
5. Estimate the following quantities:
1. Number of miles from New York to Los Angeles
2. Average weight of an elephant
3. Number of U.S. states that border the Gulf of Mexico
4. Number of months per year residents of Tromoso, Norway go without seeing a sunset
5. Highest temperature (in degrees F) ever registered in the U.S.
6. You have 10 minutes to discuss and estimate these quantities as a group.
7. You’re about half way through this round.
As a reminder, you’re estimating the following quantities as a group:
Number of miles from New York to Los Angeles
1. Average weight of an elephant
2. Number of U.S. states that border the Gulf of Mexico
3. Number of months per year residents of Tromoso, Norway go without seeing a sunset
4. Highest temperature (in degrees F) ever registered in the U.S.
8. Get ready to submit your group estimate.
9. The quantities you’re estimating are:
Number of miles from New York to Los Angeles
1. Average weight of an elephant
2. Number of U.S. states that border the Gulf of Mexico
3. Number of months per year residents of Tromoso, Norway go without seeing a sunset
4. Highest temperature (in degrees F) ever registered in the U.S.
10. Submit the team’s final group estimation by sending a message for each item starting with its number in the list above. Here’s an example for other similar questions:
   1: 14
   2: 200
   3: 13042
11. Last chance to submit!
12. This round is ending soon. Time to say goodbye to your teammates!

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Team fracture: 
Associated with low average team viability scores:  at the end of each round, each participant filled out a 14-item viability scale drawn from prior work
Attitudinal data: when at least half of a group’s members privately excluded that group from future rounds

Intellective: percent difference each teams answers were from the correct answer, and recorded the median of these values for each team interaction

## Incentives
Participants were paid $12 per hour for taking part in the experiment, and were incentivized to complete the entire study by receiving a majority of their payment as a bonus at the end of the experiment.
