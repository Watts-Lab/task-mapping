# Summary
Participants are presented with the Carter Race study (summarized below) and must decide as to whether to go ahead with a scheduled race or to terminate the planned participation in the race.  
A small racing team is at a crossroads.  They have been experiencing engine failures all season, and are down to their last dollars, and are in danger of losing their sponsors.  However, when they did not suffer engine failure, their car and team were very successful.  They are within the final hours before the last big race of the season.  If they place in the top 5, which is very plausible if they choose to race, they will secure a large sponsor, Goodstone Tires.  If they are struck with another engine failure, they will lose their current sponsors and will not be able to continue racing next season.  What do they do?

Some studies that use this case study present groups with a counter-factual mind-set manipulation scenarios that they create.

Breif decription of the pre-task scenarios:  
Counterfactual Prime Condition:  
> The protagonist Sue was at a rock concert of her favorite band.  Because her seat was not very close to the stage, Sue switched to a vacant seat in the third row.  Shortly thereafter, the emcee walked out on stage and announced that a valuable prize would be awarded to one lucky winner.  The women then reached her hand into a receptacle filled with ticket stubs and announced the winner was the person currently occupying Sue's old seat.  

Non-counterfactual Prime Condition:  
> A similar scenario was presented, except Sue did not switch seats and the winner was someone in a diffrent seat altogether.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Break up participants into groups of 3 or 4
2. Prior to beginning the actual race team task, groups were instructed to engage in a ‘‘team building exercise.’’ Embedded in the pre-task team building exercise was the manipulation of counterfactual primes.  
> Groups read the team-building scenario together and were then asked to ‘‘list some thoughts running through Sue's mind’’(Sue being the protagonist in the exercise) as a group. The sheet on which they listed their thoughts was numbered from 1 to 10, but groups were told to list only as many thoughts as came to their mind
3. Present the participants with the case study, and allow them time to read it
4. Inform groups that they can ask for extra information, but they must be very specific with what they are asking for
    1. If they ask for extra information, specifically the data containing races where the engine did not fail, they are to be supplied with page C, which contains a small bit of narrative, and Exhibit C1, a graph containing the information they had requested
5. Allow the participants to deliberate the answer for 45, and ask them to come to a group consensus
6. Once they answer they should be asked to cite reasons why they decided to race or not to race
7. Finally ask them to select their confidence on an 11 point scale, with the end points being “we are confident we made the wrong decision” and “we are confident we made the right decision” and the midpoint being neutral


## Roles 
Participant, their task is to read the case study and decide whether the team should race or not
