# Summary
Participants read two short stories and then answer knowledge questions about the store. Both stories consisted of four pages of text and took about 10 minutes to read. Two semantic tests were used. Each contained 12 questions about famous places, concepts, and names of famous persons, and so on.

Paper Two: Task Story: “War of the Ghosts”
> The story “War of the Ghosts” was recorded by a man who worked at the campus radio station and had a clear voice. This reading was copied twice onto a cassette tape so that participants heard two identical readings in immediate succession.
Story Notes: 
1. One night two young men from Egulac went down to the river to hunt seals,
2. while they were there it became foggy and calm.
3. Then they heard war cries,
4. and they thought, “Maybe this is a war party.”
5. They escaped to the shore
6. and hid behind a log.
7. Now canoes came up,
8. and they heard the noise of paddles
9. and saw one canoe coming up to them.
10. There were five men in the canoe,
11. and they said, “What do you think? We wish to take you along.
12. We are going up the river to make war on the people.”
13. One of the young men said, “I have no arrows.”
14. “Arrows are in the canoe,” they said.
15. “I will not go along.
16. I might be killed.
17. My relatives do not know where I have gone.
18. But you,” he said, turning to the other, “may go with them.”
19. So one of the young men went,
20. but the other returned home.
21. And the warriors went up the river to a town on the other side of Kalama.
22. The people came down to the water,
23. and they began to fight,
24. and many were killed.
25. But presently the young man heard one of the warriors say, “Quick, let us go home; that Indian has been hit.”
26. Now he thought, “Oh, they are ghosts.”
27. He did not feel sick,
28. but they said he had been shot.
29. So the canoes went back to Egulac,
30. and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire.
31. And he told everybody and said, “Behold, I accompanied the ghosts, and we went to a fight.
32. Many of our fellows were killed,
33. and many of those who attacked us were killed.
34. And they said I was hit
35. and I did not feel sick.
36. He told it all,
37. and then he became quiet.
38. When the sun rose he fell down.
39. Something black came out of his mouth.
40. His face became contorted.
41. The people jumped up and cried.
42. He was dead.

Questionnaire Questions: Some examples of the 8 times 3 questions, given to 124 participants
(A total of 48 questions will be used when the questions are compared to each other in the couple)

1.a.
Are there things you are better at remembering than your spouse, concerning what you will do during the day (prospective task)?

2.a.
Are there things your spouse is better at remembering than you, concerning what you will do during the day?

3.b.
How good is your memory concerning what you have experienced earlier in life (episodic tasks)?

4.b.
How good is your spouse's memory concerning what you have experienced earlier in life?

5.c.
To what extent do you normally take responsibility alone to remember things concerning separate knowledge of facts, or how things go, such as concepts, place names, names of celebrities, or the like (semantic tasks)?

6.c
To what extent does your spouse normally alone take responsibility alone to remember separate knowledge of facts, or how things go, such as concepts, place names, names of celebrities, or the like?

7.a.
To what extent are you dependent on your spouse to remember things, concerning what you will do during the day (prospective tasks)?

8.c.
To what extent is your spouse dependent on you to remember, concerning separate knowledge of facts, or how things go, such as concepts, place names, names of celebrities, or the like?

Comparisons between questions
1.1.a−1.2.a.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Each spouse in the couple receive the classification questionnaire a few weeks before the experiment. They are asked to fill in their own questionnaire alone, and send it back in a stamped envelope that was enclosed. 
2. When the couple arrive for the experiment, the experiment leader meets with them at the entrance of the building. 
3. They then answer questions about their experiences, what they knew about the place where the experiment is conducted, and related aspects. They are told that they would be taking part in an experiment concerning three types of memory – prospective, episodic and semantic memory. They are also told what the typical features are for each of these types of memory tasks. Furthermore, they were told that they were to be tested in two types of constellations, alone and together as a couple (the introduction took about 15 minutes). After having been shown an easy-to-grasp diagram of the plan for the visit, they are given some prospective tasks, which are to be solved during the walk to the room where the rest of the session was to take place (about 20 minutes).
4. They either start the test session as a couple or as individuals (this is counterbalanced throughout the experiment). 
5. When the participants had gone through the two tests in one of the two conditions, i.e. answered the semantic memory task questions as individuals and completed the episodic memory task together, for example, there is a break (about 30 minutes coffee-break). 
6. Couples then complete the parallel versions of the same memory tests (about 30 minutes). 
  > The collaboration session is videotaped, and viewed together, commented on, and discussed after the experiment (stimulated recall). T
  > he stimulated recall session is reported in a separate paper.
7. Participants are then debriefed and thanked for their participation. All in all, it took approximately 2.5–3 hours to run a couple through the complete test session.

## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
Instruction written by CSS Lab: 

Thank you for participating in our experiment today, we are looking to understand memory better specifically prospective, episodic and semantic memory. We'll be dividing you into two sessions, one where you work alone and another where you work as a couple. To help illustrate the plan for today, we've developed a diagram of the plan for your visit. 

Please read & listen to the following story. (either in pairs or individually)

After story complete...

Please answer the following questions about the story. 
Based on paper two: Please recall the story as accurately as possible from beginning to end. 

Thank you for participating in our experiment today. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Paper one: The episodic and semantic tasks were scored as correct when the name, the number, the main idea, or the description of an item was correctly recalled (1 point per correct answer). The maximum score for each test was 12 points. 

The nominal pair score was computed when the two spouses worked alone. The nominal pair score represented the pooled, non-redundant performance of the two individuals (cf. Andersson & Rönnberg, 1995; Faust, 1959). 
> If one individual recalled item a, b, c, and d and the partner recalled item b, d, e, g, their nominal pair score would be 6 (a, b, c, d, e, g). 

Paper Two: The story was divided into the 42 propositional units (see Stimuli above) suggested by Mandler and Johnson (1977; see Appendix). For the recalls, each unit was scored as wrong (0); partially correct (.5), meaning that part of the gist was correct; or correct (1), meaning that the whole gist was correct. Two judges scored each recall independently and then conferred to resolve any discrepancies.
