# Summary
The goal of this task is to work with a group to figure out how to assemble tubing to blow out candles. The solution is as follows:
> A long tube can be constructed by connecting the pieces of glass tubing together with the rubber tubing. Clamps are used to fasten the tube to the long poles to make it rigid. Then the candles can be blown out by placing one end of the tube near the flame and blowing through the other end.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Several pieces of glass tubing and rubber tubing, 6 to 12 inches in length; poles several feet in length; several paper clamps; two candles
>> Materials are placed on table along with other assorted materials; candles are placed about two feet apart on the table and lighted

# Procedure
## Steps
Groups are faced with the stimuli listed above

Participants are read the instructions, and are to assemble a way to blow out the candles as quickly as possible while standing 8 feet away.

They are timed during this task

## Roles 
Participants had to work together to complete the task
