# Summary
Participants were organized into groups of four and performed a series of tasks in a series of rounds with old and new group members. In this task participants are asked to write short online text advertisements for product campaigns from Kickstarter. In this setup, participants collectively author a 30 character byline advertisement.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants assigned to task group- the teams were allocated based on social golfer matching, so that each collaboration
consists of members who have never interacted before in groups of 3-4 people 
2. Participants play four rounds of that task (order balanced across groups: 2 with same group, two with new group). Teams wrote
ads for different Kickstarter projects in each round, so they would never repeat the exact same task. At the end of the round, the team collectively
decided on a final advertisement and one member submitted it on behalf of the team. Each team had 10 minutes to complete each advertisement
3. At the end of each round participants complete a viability scale
4. At the end of all rounds participants attitudinal data collected 


## Instructions

The following instructions appear during the course of the activity:
1. As a team, brainstorm as many ad slogans as possible and then narrow down your ideas to determine your final ad submission.
2. Your final ad will appear online.
3. The more successful it is, the larger the bonus each team member will be paid.
4. The ad must be no more than 30 characters long. Instructions for submission will appear later.
5. There are a total of 5 rounds of team interaction with a 5 minute reflection survey following each one. You will only receive the stated bonus pay if you thoughtfully fill out every survey question.
6. Your ads will be reviewed and checked after each task. If you go AFK on your teammates, you will NOT receive the stated pay.
7. Say hello to your team members. Begin brainstorming ideas together!
8. As a team, discuss and narrow down your ideas!
9. Polish your team’s favorite ad and get ready to submit. Submit your ad by adding a '!' in front of the ad. For example, '!Ad text here.” Remember, your final ad can’t be more than a maximum of 30 characters long.
10. This round is ending soon! Say goodbye to your teammates.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Team fracture: 
Associated with low average team viability scores:  at the end of each round, each participant filled out a 14-item viability scale drawn from prior work

Attitudinal data: when at least half of a group members privately excluded that group from future rounds 

Ad Performance: 
For the creative ad writing task, each advertisement was added to a campaign for the product on Google Ads. We turned off any optimization, ensuring that ads were seen at the same rate. After 48 hours, we recorded each ad’s click through rate (CTR) as a measure of the group’s performance

## Incentives
Participants were paid $10 per task which typically took an hour and were also offered a bonus of up to $2 for above average work
