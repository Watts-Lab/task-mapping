# Summary
This study looks at the effects of time limits and different task types on the quality and quantity of group performance and patterns of group interaction, specifically how time limits effect of ten and twenty minutes impact story generation (production).

# Procedure
## Steps
> Step One: Participants in the experiment were randomly assigned to groups of 4. Each same-sex group was then randomly assigned to one of the six group conditions (three task types and two time limits). Participants told they were in study on task types and told time limits on the task performance group. They were told an observer would be in the room to make periodic observations 
> Step Two: The experimenter read the first problem to the group, give a time limit for the first session and instruct participants to use the full time available.
      This instruction was intended to counteract the participants desire to finish the experiment as quickly as possible
> Step Three: Once the first trial is complete, experimenters collected the solutions and pass out a questionnaire 
> Step Four: Experimenter would read second problem when all participants had finished the questionnaire and would begin timing the session/making observations  
> Step Five: Once the second trial was complete, experimenters collected the solutions and pass out a questionnaire
> Step Six: once the questionnaires were completed the participants were debriefed and excused 

## Roles 
No roles were assigned to participants however participants were assigned to four person same-sex groups for the tasks

An observer would be in the room to make periodic observations throughout the session. The observer would not be able to help the group in any way. 

## Instructions
Complete instructions were not included but participants saw prompts that require that the group generate ideas or images. An example of the task used was: “Using only quotations or paraphrasing, construct a coherent and meaningful story from the following nursery rhymes

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The quality of the written reports were assessed on four dimensions developed by Hackman, Jones and McGrath (1967) (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1967-10399-001): 
> The dimensions are: length, originality, quality of presentation, adequacy and creativity and one dimension assessing the length (Quantity)
> All group products were rated on scales assessing five dimensions using a 7- pile sort-resort procedure by three judges- two assessed each dimension and all three assessed product rating, scores for dimensions were averaged in analysis  

> Observations of group behavior were also recorded- an observer recorded a code for each comment at the ten second mark of ten second intervals 
> Observers underwent a month of training based on an interrater reliability criterion of 0.9
