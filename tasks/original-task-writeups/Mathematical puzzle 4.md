# Summary
In this task, participants were given a mathematical problem and were asked to solve the problem as a group. The problem involved figuring out who is the winner of the tennis tournament given the number and results of some of the matches.

## The visual components
The following problem statement is provided to the participant:

Eight men entered a tennis tournament at Golfview. The tournament was played in three consecutive days, one round per day. No match was defaulted. The first and second round matches were stipulated to be 2 sets out of 3, whereas the final round was 3 sets out of 5. After the tournament had ended, the following information about the tournament was widely known: Easton never played against Henderson. Before the play began, Gordon remarked to Bentley, 'I see that we meet in the finals.'
Chester won a set at love but lost his first match. Altogether, 140 games were played, of which the losers won 43. When the pairings were posted, Anderson said to Dalton, 'Do you concede, or do you want to play it out?' On the second day, the first round losers played bridge, and at the same table gathered on the third day with Easton in place of Anderson. Bentley won 9 games. Francis won 37 games. The first score of the tournament was a service ace by Gordon, at which Easton shouted, 'Hey, I'm not over there.'

Who won the tournament?

# Procedure
## Steps
1. 49 judges who sorted 104 tasks into eight categories (or piles) representing different positions on the dimension under consideration. 
2. Each judge sorted the tasks on all dimensions, but no one sorted tasks on more than one dimension on a given day, and usually the sortings were separated by several days. 
3. The orders in which dimensions were sorted by the various judges were random, and the set of tasks was shuffled by E before each sorting. 
4. Each task was typed on a separate sheet which included all the information  
5. For a given dimension, the judge was given the set of tasks, a definition of dimension (exactly as given above), and a copy of the Archives of the History of American Psychology, The Center for the History of Psychology, The University of Akron CHP Special Interest Collection 
6. When the sorting had been completed, the judge placed each pile of tasks in an appropriately labeled manila envelope and returned them to E, who recorded the responses.

## Instructions
Overall sorting instructions: 
1. The sheets you have been given contain information about group tasks. These have been  selected  from a variety  of  tasks  used  in  small  group research  projects  reported  in  psychological  journals.

As a first step in assigning scale values to these tasks, we want  a number  of persons  to  sort  them  into  8 piles.  You  will  probably  find  it easier  to  sort  them  if you  look over  a  number  of  tasks, chosen  at random,  before  you begin  to  sort.  

2. Steps in sorting: 
> a. You have been given 8 manila envelopes with letters on them. Please  arrange  these  before  you  in regular  order.  
> b. Begin by sorting the tasks into four piles^ On envelope A place  those  tasks  that  you believe  are highest  with  regard  to  the dimension  (name  of  dimension).   On envelope  C  place  the  tasks  that  are  next  highest  on  this dimension;   on   envelope  E those  that  are  next highest;   and  on  envelope  G  those  that  are  lowest with  regard  to  the  dimension  (name  of  dimension).  
> c. When you have completed step b, divide each of the piles into  two more  piles  to make  a total  of  8 piles more  or  less  evenly  distributed  T,lor)g>tho  scale.  For  example,  those  tasks  you have  placed  on  envelope  A  should  be divided  so  that  those  that  are highest  on  the dimension  in  question  are  placed  on  A  and  those  that  are next highest  are  placed  on B;   similarly,  those  on envelope  C  are  divided  and  placed  on envelopes  C  and  J; etc. 
> d. Reconsider, look back and forth from pile to pile, reshuffle tasks  as much  as may  be  necessary  to be  sure  that  you  have  each  task  in the pile  that  you  think  it  should  be  in. 

3. DO NOT TRY TO GST THE SAME NUMBER IN SACK PILE. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY  EVENLY DISTRIBUTED  ALONG  THE  DIMENSION.  

4. In any case in which you may consider it important, you may assume  the  following  conditions: 
>  a. The instructions listed on the task sheet are minimal; it  is  assumed  that  they  are understood  by  all  group members.
>  b. The first of the several criteria listed is the one to be useo  in evaluating  group performance  on  the  task.  
>  c. The size of the group is five persons. 
>  d. Subjects are selected randomly from a population of college undergraduates. 
>  e. The  group  is unstructured;   that  is, no  structure  is  imposed  on  the group,  no  leader  is assigned,  no restrictions  are  placed  on  communication  channels, etc., except  as  specified  on  the  task  information  sheet

5. When you have completed the sorting, please place each pile in the  corresponding  envelope  and  return  to me.

Mathematical puzzle 4 instructions: 
This is a group task. Work on the task cooperatively, trying to arrive at an answer to the quesrion posed in the problem statement that is agreeable to everyone. If you cannot agree, a minority report will be accepted along with the majority decision. Let me know when you have arrived at an answer.
