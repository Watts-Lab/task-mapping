# Summary
In the task, groups of four were to decide which of 144 sections of land, represented by a 12 by 12 matric on a 80-cm by 80-cm board, were suitable for drilling oil. When the team decided that a particular spot was suitable, a member pulled on of the tabs which appeared on every one of th 144 sections. If the team decided correctly, a red dot appeared on the reverse side oft he tab; otherwise, the tab was blank. There were 33 red dots altogether.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Subects came to the laboratory and were introduced to each other by name 
2. The experimenter explained that the purpose of the experiment was to understand how people make decisions in groups.
3. The subjects completed a translated version of Fiedler's (1967) LPC.
4. The experimenter informed the groups that they simulated an interdiciplinary team of scientists in a consulting firm whose task it was to choose areas of land in which there was a high probability of discovering oil.
5. Each member received a 12 by 12 map showing land sections fulilling only one of the four criteria that would have to be met in order for a red dot to appear on the tab (chemical composition of land, surface hardness, surface mantle thickness, and geological stratification)
6. They were given 1 minute to memorize the map without using a paper or pencil
7. Subjects were then told them whether they had 3, 5, or 15 minutes to complete the group task. They were informed that in the past groups without time limits had taken about 10 minutes to complete the same task comfortably.
8. Groups were then to decide which of the 144 sections of land were suitable for drilling oil. When the team decided on a spot, a member pulled one of the tabs to see if there was a red dot or if the tab was blank. They were told that there were 33 red dots ("hits") altogether
9.  The subjects were paid according to the number of accurate recommendations they made, and for each mistake they would lose money (points)
10.  They were asked to complete a 7-point scale for sociometric ratings and 6 7-point scales to assess group process


## Roles 
Two observers: each observed two of the four group members

## Instructions
> Adapted from Fosmire task by CSS Lab

Thank you for taking part in our study, you will be taking part in a simulation and are a part of an interdiciplinary team of scientists in a consulting firm whose task it was to choose areas of land in which there was a high probability of discovering oil. Imagine your team to be a real estate firm commissioned to purchase lands for your clients for drilling oil. 

One client, a wetlands scientist, requires a site with a specific chemical composition of land. The site must have adequate water (a lake) available to carry off excess heat. It must have live rock near the surface to provide adequate foundations. It must be near a railroad in order that heavy equipment be inexpensively moved into position, and near an urban center to minimize distribution costs.

A second client seeks a site with surface hardness. It must be located on a lake, of course. Soil must be deep and fertile (i.e., stone not near the surface). It must be relatively remote, i.e., non,urban and away from railway arteries.

A third client seeks a site for surface mantle thickness in the ground. 

A fourth client is seeking a site with geological stratification. This facility must be placed in a fertile, rural area. Humidity must be low, thus it must not be placed near a body of water.

Available to you is a map displaying the distribution of land, a map displaying the distribution of urban development, a map displaying the distribution of surface projections of live rock, and a map displaying the pattern of rail service. 

Please take one minute to study the map.

Three Minute Condition: 
You will now have 3 minutes to decide which of the 144 sections of land were suitable for drilling oil. For some background information, groups without time limits have taken about 10 minutes to complete the same task comfortably. When you have come to decision you can pull on the tabs on the board to see if there is a red dot ("hit"), there are 33 hits on the board. Please note, you will be paid according to the number of accurate recommendations you make, and you will lose money for each mistake. 

Five Minute Condition: 
You will now have 5 minutes to decide which of the 144 sections of land were suitable for drilling oil. For some background information, groups without time limits have taken about 10 minutes to complete the same task comfortably. When you have come to decision you can pull on the tabs on the board to see if there is a red dot ("hit"), there are 33 hits on the board. Please note, you will be paid according to the number of accurate recommendations you make, and you will lose money for each mistake. 

Fifteen Minute Condition: 
You will now have 15 minutes to decide which of the 144 sections of land were suitable for drilling oil. For some background information, groups without time limits have taken about 10 minutes to complete the same task comfortably. When you have come to decision you can pull on the tabs on the board to see if there is a red dot ("hit"), there are 33 hits on the board. Please note, you will be paid according to the number of accurate recommendations you make, and you will lose money for each mistake. 

After Task: 
Thank you for your work on the task, you will now fill out a short questionnaire on the process. 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
1. Decision-making accuracy: assessed by number of hits (finds), misses (mistakes), frequencies of hits and misses (hits/min and misses/min) and two indices of efficiency, misses/hit and (hits-misses)/(hits+misses)
2. Amount of communication: one communication tally for every complete phrase, purposeful pointing to a space, or phrase plus pointing to a space
3. Sociometric ratings: 7-point scales in which members rated their own willingness to work with each other on a similar task, or to participate with him or her in a social function
4. Group process: 6 7 point-scales assessed leadership, satisfaction with the group's output, satisfaction with the way the team functioned, pleasantness of the task, amount of stress each member experiences, and time-sufficience.
