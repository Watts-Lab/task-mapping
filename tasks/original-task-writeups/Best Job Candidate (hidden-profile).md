# Summary
Participants  read  information  about  three  candidates who supposedly had applied for an assistant professorship based on profiles constructed from previous participant rating of information. Not all information about candidates are provided to all participants creating a hidden profile, they then discuss with groups what candidate they would hire.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Candidate profiles were not included in the paper however guidelines on their construction were: 
> Within  the  positive,  negative,  and neutral  categories,  items  were  selected  that  were  about equally  desirable  and  important,  and  only  the  number  of(un)desirable  items  varied  across  candidates.  Each  profile consisted  of  12  items  of  information,  set  up  so  that  candidate A had more positive characteristics (six positive, three neutral, and three negative) than B or C (three positive, six neutral, and three negative).

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Upon arrival in   the   laboratory, participants were assigned randomly to groups and conditions.  
2. Group members were seated separately from each other and read that the researchers were interested in group decision making.  After a brief  explanation of the experimental  procedure, process accountability was manipulated.
  > Participants  in  the  process  accountability  condition  were  told that to gain more insight into the process by which groups come to  reach a decision, we would like to schedule a follow-up interview with them. During this interview  they would  be  asked  to  elaborate  on  the  decision-making process.  We asked them to indicate, on a  separate sheet of paper, when they might be available for an interview. Participants   in the non-accountability condition did not receive this additional instruction.
3. Following  the  manipulation  of  process  accountability, all participants were asked to carefully read the profiles of the three candidates A, B, and C. 
4. After 10 min of reviewing the candidate profiles,  everyone filled  out  a  pre-discussion questionnaire in which we measured candidate  preference and perceived  information  sufficiency.
5. Participants were then seated  together  as  a  group.  They  received  instructions  to discuss the information and to decide which of the  three candidates they  would  hire.  To  avoid  confusion,  we  also asked them to record their decision on a sheet of paper. 
6. We informed group members of the possibility that not everybody  had  read  the  exact  same  information.  
7. Participants assigned  to the accountability  condition  were  reminded  of the  interview,  and  instructed  to  be  aware  of  the  way  in which a decision was made. Group discussions were video-taped.
8. After discussion participants were again seated individually and filled out a post-discussion questionnaire, in which we  measured  perceptions of information  sufficiency  again, and  assessed the adequacy of our experimental  manipulations.  
9. Upon completion of this questionnaire, participants were debriefed and rewarded for their participation.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Information dissemination: (type of information exchanged, repetition of information exchanged)from transcribed group discussions
> Information was identified as either correct or incorrect, and classified it according to the candidate it pertained to

Information exchange was  defined as the number of items mentioned at least once, divided by the total number of items available in the group,  i.e.,  the  total  number  of items  included  in  the  profiles. 

Repetition of information was defined as the number of times  information  was  repeated  after  having  been  mentioned once

Group performance, measured in terms of the quality of the  groupâ€™s decision, was  coded dichotomously as (in)correctness of choice. Groups opting for candidate A received a score of 1 (correct), whereas groups not opting for candidate A received a score of 0 (incorrect).

## Incentives
Participants either received course credit or 10 Euros  (approx. $12US dollars).
