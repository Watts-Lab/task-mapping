# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were assigned randomly to groups of 4
2. Each of the groups was assigned either face-to-face collaboration or online collaboration. Participants in the online group were serated randomly in a large room and used a text-chat to communicate with group members
3. All participants had personal laptops and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the task.
4. Groups were presented with a list of 24 randomly scrambled words. Groups had 2 minutes to unscramble as many of the words as possible. Each word only had one correct answer.
5. Individuals completed the Reading in Mind's Eye (RME) Test. The test consists of 36 images of only the eyes of individuals, and participants are asked to choose among four possible mental states to describe the person whose eyes are pictured. The options are all complex mental states (e.g., shame, guilt, curiosity, desire) rather than simple emotions (e.g., happiness, anger).
6. Individuals completed a Five Factor Personality Inventory. This test measures Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Neuroticism. Sixty items are responded to on a 1 to 5 scale; the mean for each scale was calculated for each participant.


## Instructions
This is a test of your ability to unscramble a group of letters and make a word out of them. 
Look at the groups of letters below. If they are unscrambled, each group will spell a common English word.

	I. 	mtri
	II.	nwti
	III.	ltfa

The first group spells trim when it is unscrambled. The second group spells twin;  and the third group spells flat.

Your score on this test will be the number of words that you unscramble correctly.  Therefore, it will not be to your advantage to spend a lot of time on a hard word. Remember that all of the unscrambled words are common English words;  proper names (of people and places) are not used.



# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Participants were awarded one point per correct word on the RME test.

## Incentives
Participants were paid a lump sum regardless of performance. The amount is undisclosed in the SI Text.
