# Procedure
## Steps
> 1. Participants were assigned randomly to groups of 4
> 2. Each of the groups was assigned either face-to-face collaboration or online collaboration. Participants in the online group were serated randomly in a large room and used a text-chat to communicate with group members
> 3. All participants had personal laptops and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the task.
> 4. Groups were presented with a list of 24 randomly scrambled words. Groups had 2 minutes to unscramble as many of the words as possible. Each word only had one correct answer.
> 5. Individuals completed the Reading in Mind's Eye (RME) Test. The test consists of 36 images of only the eyes of individuals, and participants are asked to choose among four possible mental states to describe the person whose eyes are pictured. The options are all complex mental states (e.g., shame, guilt, curiosity, desire) rather than simple emotions (e.g., happiness, anger).
> 6. Individuals completed a Five Factor Personality Inventory. This test measures Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Neuroticism. Sixty items are responded to on a 1 to 5 scale; the mean for each scale was calculated for each participant.


## Instructions
> 1. Participants were instructued to complete the tasks with their group on their computer
> 2. Participants were instructured to take a series of personality tests.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Participants were awarded one point per correct word.

## Incentives
Participants were paid a lump sum regardless of performance. The amount is undisclosed in the SI Text.
