# Summary
Groups or individual participants work to find a rule that is being used to split a deck of cards into two groups, examples and non examples.  The first card is given by the experimenter and is always an example of the rule.  after that groups/individuals write down hypotheses of what the rule is, and then play a card in an attempt to figure out the rule.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
A standard deck of 52 playing cards, without jokers.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Laughlin and Shupe (1996) allowed for 32 different rules (or patterns), which contained four patterns that were of length five.  This is different from other experiment spaces.  There description of the rules is as follows: 
> The correct rules were patterns of alternation over four or five cards (e.g., ‘‘two diamonds alternate with two clubs’’). Abbreviating clubs as C, diamonds as D, hearts as H, spades as S, red (diamonds or hearts) as R, and black (clubs or spades) as B, the 32 rules were DDCC, DDHH, DDSS, SSDD, SSCC, SSHH, DCHS, DHCS, DHSC, SCHD, SCDH, SHCD, DCCC, DHHH, DSSS, SDDD, SCCC, SHHH, DDDS, SSSD, DDDDS, SSSSD, RRBB, BBRR, RBBB, BRRR, RRRB, BBBR, RRBBB, BBRRR, RRRBB, and BBBRR, with one rule for each of the 32 replications. (Laughlin and Shupe, 1996)


Other versions of the experiment, such as McGlynn, et al.  allowed for a brain storming session on either trial 3 (third card drawn) or trial 9 (ninth card drawn).  During these brain storming sessions, groups/individuals were given the following instructions.
> * (1)  Criticism is ruled out. Make sure each hypothesis fits the cards, but otherwise adverse judgment of ideas must be withheld (and no one should criticize any- one elseÕs ideas/so donÕt criticize any ideas that come to mind). Say everything you think of that fits the cards.  
> * (2)  Freewheeling is welcome. The more creative the idea, the better. It is easier to tame down than to think up. DonÕt be afraid to say anything that comes to mind. As long as it fits the cards, the more un- usual the hypothesis the better. This will stimulate more and better ideas.  
> * (3)  Combination and improvement are sought. (You should try to suggest how ideas of others can be joined or changed into still better ideas./You should try to join or change ideas you have into still better ideas). DonÕt be afraid to combine and improve on them.  
> * (4)  Most important: quantity is wanted. The greater the number of ideas, the more the likelihood of winners. Come up with as many as you can that fit the cards 
The experimenter would read these rules to participants and then instructed them to brainstorm for 10 minutes.  The instructor would then start a tape recorder and leave the room.  The experimenter would enter the room at the 3, 6 and 9 minute mark, and if no brainstorming was happening, they would prompt the group as follows; “Keep going. Please don’t forget that it’s the total number of ideas that counts in brainstorming.”  At the 10 minute mark the experimenter would enter the room, stop the tape recorder and instruct the participants to continue the experiment, starting by writing down individual hypotheses for the third or ninth card.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are randomly broken into groups of four (or five in the case of Laughlin and Shipply) or are selected to complete the task in the nominal(individual) setting.
2. Participants then followed instructions in an attempt to find the rule.

## Roles 
Participants worked either individually or in a group in an attempt to identify a pattern.

## Instructions
From Laughlin and Shupe 1996:
This is an experiment in problem solving, the two groups of four will solve the same problem in separate rooms(groups are random). The objective is to find a rule that divides an ordinary deck of playing cards into two groups, examples and non examples of that rule.  Aces are 1, twos are 2 and so on, up to jacks as 11, queens as 12 and kings as 13.  The rule may be based on any characteristic of the card, I.e. the rule may be ‘diamonds’ such that all diamonds would be an example of the rule, and all hearts, spades and clubs would be non examples.  I will start you with a card that is an example of the rule.  The first step will be for each of you to write down your individual hypothesis on your individual hypothesis sheet.  Then the four of you will decide on a group hypothesis, and the recorder (designated at random) will record the groups decision on the group decision sheet.  Then you will play any of the 52 cards you choose, if the card is also an example of the rule it will be placed to the right of known example card, if not it will be placed below the last card played.  This procedure will continue for ten trials, and you will then make your final hypothesis and group hypothesis and I will tell you whether or not your final group hypothesis is correct.

Laughlin and Shipply 1983 followed a similar procedure, however they did not limit based on trials, rather they gave groups/indivudals 1 hour to complete the task, if they reached the correct solution early enough, another problem set was started.

McGlynn, et al. is similar, however the experimenter provided each successive card rather than letting the group select cards.  Negative examples appears on trials 3, 5, 6, 10, and 12. The ninth card displayed ruled out most color based hypotheses if the rule was even-odd based, or it ruled out most even-odd hypotheses if the rule was color based. Their experiment ran for 12 trials.

McGlynn, et al. also asked participants to fill out a questionnaire after the experiment.  One question asking the participants to estimate the number of hypotheses they personally generated.  The other two questions were as follows:
	The other two questions asked participants to compare their personal performance to what they be- lieved it would have been had they been in the opposite condition: ‘‘If you had been asked to brainstorm (alone/ in a group with three other people) on this problem, do you think that you personally would have generated more or fewer ideas than you did brainstorming (in a group of three other people/alone). Responses were re- corded on a nine-point scales with ‘‘many fewer ideas alone/in a group’’ and ‘‘many more ideas in a group’’ as the anchors. A parallel question asked about ‘‘better or worse’’ ideas and responses were recorded on a nine- point scales with ‘‘much worse ideas alone/in a group’’ and ‘‘much better ideas in a group’’ as the anchors(McGlynn, et al).
Once the session was completed the experimenter informed subjects on the correct rule and explained the purpose of the experiment.


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
In McGlynn, et al, performance was measured in the group/individuals ability to generate different hypotheses during the brainstorming sessions.  These hypotheses were counted, and measured in quantity, and their plausibility.  

Other experiments measure the group/individuals ability to use induction to arrive at the correct rule.

## Incentives
All participants completed this task to fulfill option for class credit at their university.
