<p>
  One player, the proposer, is endowed with a sum of money. The proposer is
  tasked with splitting it with another player, the responder.
</p>
<p>
  Once the proposer communicates their decision, the responder may accept it or
  reject it.
</p>

<p>
  If the responder accepts, the money is split per the proposal; if the
  responder rejects, both players receive nothing.
</p>
<p>
  Both players know in advance the consequences of the responder accepting or
  rejecting the offer.
