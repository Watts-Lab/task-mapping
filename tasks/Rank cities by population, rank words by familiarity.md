# Procedure
## Steps
Groups are faced with the lists of cities or words, as seen above. 

Participants are then read the instructions, and are to collectively complete the rankings. 

Time and accuracy are recorded.

## Roles 
Participants have to work together to complete the tasks.

## Instructions
For cities:
> Your task will be to rank to cities listed on the problem sheet according to their population as indicated by the 1960 census. That is, assign a rank of 1 to the city which has the largest population, a rank of 2 to the city which has the next largest population, etc. Are there any questions about this procedure? (Make sure task is understood by everyone.) You will be given 10 minutes to discuss the problem and arrive at a group ranking.

For words:
>Your task is to rank the words on your problem sheet in order of familiarity. Give a rank of 1 to the word that you think is most familiar to persons in this country (i.e., most common), a rank of 2 to the word that is next most familiar, etc. First, each of you will rank the words individually. Then you will work together as a group and arrive at a group ranking of the words. Work as quickly and as accurately as you can.

# Criteria
