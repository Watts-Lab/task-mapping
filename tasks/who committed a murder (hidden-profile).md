# Summary
Participants review evidence in a homicide investigation. The task was de-signed so that the evidence suggested three possible suspects,but two of these suspects could be ruled out, and the remainingone implicated, if a set of critical clues were considered. To create a hidden profile, these critical clues were unshared in some conditions to mask the identity of the guilty suspect. We manipulated the perceived demonstrability of the correctness of choices by instructional set. 

In judge conditions, we told participants before they read the evidence and met in groups that their task was to decide which suspect "was most likely tohave committed the crime" and noted that they may not have sufficient information to determine definitely who was guilty.

In solve conditions, we simply told participants that their task was to determine who was the guilty suspect.

## The visual components
Participants read a series of interviews from a homicide investigation; these interviews were presented in a 27-page booklet that included other supporting materials such as a map, a handwritten note,and a newspaper article.
> These interviews contained 24 clues that were either incriminating or exonerating for each of the three suspects(E, B, and M). Specifically, there were 6 incriminating clues about each suspect, but there were also 3 clues that exonerated B and likewise 3 clues that exonerated M. Therefore, the total set of 24 clues was de-signed so that Suspects B and M could be ruled out as viable suspects. Also, all of the clues considered together supported the conclusion that Suspect E had both motive and opportunity to commit the crime and had attempted to frame Suspect B.
> Three incriminating clues about Suspect E and the six clues that exonerated Suspects M and B were critical for identifying E as the guilty party. To create a hidden profile, these nine clues were un-shared. 


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions, with the following con-straints: 
> (a) Participants were assigned to groups to maximize the num-ber of 3- and 6-person groups in each experimental session 
>  (b)groups were assigned to experimental conditions so that the number ineach cell of the design was approximately equal at all times
2. Participants met in a large room at the beginning of the session.Preliminary instructions stated that the research was interested in how groups use information to make decisions. After the introduction, the instructions varied depending on the task set condition. 
3. Participants individually read and reviewed the interviews for approximately 30 min. They then completed a private, prediscussion questionnaire. On this questionnaire, participants in the solve conditions indicated which of the three suspects they thought was guilty whereas participants in the judge conditions ranked the three suspects from most to least likely of being guilty
> In 3-person groups, each member received only three of the critical clues: one incriminating clue about E, one exonerating clue about M, and one exonerating clue about B. Nonetheless, the 3 members collectively had all of the information. For the 6-person groups in the hidden profile conditions, 3 group members received the same pattern of critical clues as described earlier for 3-person groups. The other 3 members in the 6-person groupreceived only the shared information and none of the critical clues.
4. In the second part of the session, groups met in adjacent rooms todiscuss the suspects. 
> In the judge conditions, groups were instructed to decide on a ranking of the suspects from most to least likely of having committed the crime. 
> In the solve conditions, they were told to decide which one of the three suspects was guilty. 
5. All groups were given up to 30 min to reach decisions but could end their discussion whenever they reached unanimous agreement.After discussion ended, participants rated the sufficiency of the available information for determining who was the guilty suspect.


## Instructions
Judge Condition: The detectives in the case do not have sufficientevidence to charge anybody for the homicide. . . we are asking you to use the available evidence and decide which of the suspects seems mos tlikely to have committed the crime." 

Solve Condition:,". . . only one of the suspects could have committed the crime. We would like you to read over the materials carefully and to decide who you think committed the crime."

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Pre-Discussion Choices: Researchers evaluted how people responded to the prediscussion questionnaire based on information conditions. The proportion oftimes that Suspect E (the "correct" choice) was chosen as guilty(solve task set) or "most likely to have committed the crime"(judge task set) was analyzed in a 2 (group size: 3 vs. 6) X 2 (taskset: solve vs. judge) X 2 (prediscussion information distribu-tion: all shared vs. hidden profile) log-linear analysis

Discussion Choices: Groups in the solve set conditions decided which suspect was guilty, whereas groups in the judge set conditions decided which suspect was most likely to have committed the crime.F As with prediscussion preferences, they then analyze the group decision data in a 2 (group size) X2 (task set) X 2 (prediscussion information distribution) log-lin-ear analysis.

Discussion Content: Two coders listened to audio recordings of each group discussion and noted each time a clue or fact was mentioned.During coding, items were not distinguished as being critical ornoncritical clues or details; coders merely recorded a code associated with an item of information when it was mentioned during discussion.
> 24 total clues,9 were critical for demonstratingthat Suspect E committed the crime, whereas Suspects M and B did not. 
> In the subsequent analyses, we refer to these 9 as the critical clues. 
> The remaining 15 clues that collectively tended toimplicate the wrong suspects (M and B) are called the noncritical clues. 
> In addition, there were 32 facts that provided background information that are known as details
