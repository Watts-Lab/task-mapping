# Summary
Participants review evidence in a homicide investigation. The task was de-signed so that the evidence suggested three possible suspects,but two of these suspects could be ruled out, and the remainingone implicated, if a set of critical clues were considered. To create a hidden profile, these critical clues were unshared in some conditions to mask the identity of the guilty suspect. We manipulated the perceived demonstrability of the correctness of choices by instructional set. 

In judge conditions, we told participants before they read the evidence and met in groups that their task was to decide which suspect "was most likely tohave committed the crime" and noted that they may not have sufficient information to determine definitely who was guilty.

In solve conditions, we simply told participants that their task was to determine who was the guilty suspect.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Participants read a series of interviews from a homicide investigation; these interviews were presented in a 27-page booklet that included other supporting materials such as a map, a handwritten note,and a newspaper article.
> These interviews contained 24 clues that were either incriminating or exonerating for each of the three suspects(E, B, and M). Specifically, there were 6 incriminating clues about each suspect, but there were also 3 clues that exonerated B and likewise 3 clues that exonerated M. Therefore, the total set of 24 clues was de-signed so that Suspects B and M could be ruled out as viable suspects. Also, all of the clues considered together supported the conclusion that Suspect E had both motive and opportunity to commit the crime and had attempted to frame Suspect B.
> Three incriminating clues about Suspect E and the six clues that exonerated Suspects M and B were critical for identifying E as the guilty party. To create a hidden profile, these nine clues were un-shared.

LOCAL BUSINESSMAN MURDERED Robert Guion, a prominent local businessman was found dead behind his Crestview home this morning.  Detective Lt. Mark Moody of the Hilltown precinct reported that Mr. Guion had apparently been assaulted when leaving his home to play golf early this morning.  He was struck on the head over the left eye and fell down a flight of stairs leading from a second story deck at the rear of the house.


The preliminary coroner’s report concluded that death was cause by injuries sustained from the fall and not from the blow to the head.  The report estimated that Mr. Guion’s death occurred between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.  Lt. Moody would neither confirm nor deny rumors that Mr. Guion had been robbed.  “We’re following all leads.  That’s all I have to say for now,” said Lt. Moody.

Marion Guion
Excerpts from 
Lt. Moody’s (Lt.M) interview with 
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:	Mrs. Guion, I know this isn’t going to be easy, but I need you to answer some questions for me.

Ms. G:	It’s OK.  It has to be done.  And please call me Marion.

Lt. M:	OK,… Marion,… tell me what you remember about Saturday morning.

Ms. G:	Well, I always sleep in on Saturday’s.  I got up around 9 or 9:15 and did aerobics from 9:30 to 10.  After that I showered and was drying my hair when I heard a knock at the patio door.  It was Eddie Sullivan, our handyman.

Lt. M:	That was about 10:30?

Ms. G:	Yes, I think so…  I’m not absolutely sure.

Lt. M:	You are sure about the times that you got up and did aerobics?

Ms. G:	Yes, I’m fairly sure of those times.  You see, I watch an aerobics program on TV; it’s on every morning from 9:30 to 10.

Lt. M:	So, when Mr. Sullivan told you that your husband was hurt, what did you do?

Ms. G:	He didn’t actually tell me that it was Bob… not at first.  He just said that there had been an accident and that I should call an ambulance…  I remember feeling scared, but it didn’t occur to me that it might be Bob.

Lt. M:	This was the first that you knew that something had happened?

Ms. G:	Yes, Bob always plays golf on Saturday morning; he always leaves early and doesn’t return until 11 or so.  I though he was at the country club.

Lt. M:	You said that you were scared.  Did you suspect the Mr. Sullivan wasn’t telling you everything?

Ms. G:	Not really… I suppose that I was just reacting to the urgency in Eddie’s voice.

Lt. M:	Do you know if Mr. Guion ever left the house during the morning?

Ms. G:	No, I’m not sure.  All I remember is that he was talking on the phone in the study… it’s across the hall from the bedroom.  I remember it was light outside.. must have been around 6.  Next thing I knew, I heard voices, or a voice… shouting… I’m not sure.  I was still half-asleep.  It sounded like it was coming from outside.

Lt. M:	Where is the bedroom located?

Ms. G:	At the back of the house, on the northwest corner.  Anyway, I thought it was Bob.  I though maybe he was yelling at the cat.  She sometimes runs out of the patio door when he’s leaving and it infuriates him.  But then I heard what sounded like a groan… and something fall.  This woke me up completely.  I went to the window and looked out but didn’t see anything.

Lt. M:	Can you see the deck from your window?

Marion Guion

Ms. G:	No, not very well.  I remember looking at the clock.  It was about 6:40.  I thought, “Bob is usually gone by now.”  Then I heard a car on the gravel driveway.  I went to the study window at the front of the house but didn’t see anyone.

Lt. M:	Did you think it was a car leaving?

Ms. G:	Yes, I thought so.  I saw Bob’s pickup in the carport and I assumed that he took the Mercury out of the garage.  Sometimes he takes the pickup.  I remember thinking that the noise I heard must have been the garage door closing.  It always comes down with such a bang.

Lt. M:	Can you see under the carport from the study window?

Ms. G:	Oh… yes, I can see under it completely.

Lt. M:	So you suspected nothing until Mr. Sullivan came to the patio door?

Ms. G:	That’s right.  I thought it was unusual that he was at the back door.  He usually comes to the front door.  And he looked upset.  He opened the door partway when he saw me and shouted, “Call an ambulance.  There’s been an accident.” Or something like that.  He made it sound very urgent.

Lt. M:	So what did you do?

Ms. G:	I called for an ambulance like he said…  Then I went out… on the deck (bursts into tears).

Lt. M:	I know that this is hard Marion… but we’re just about through.

Ms. G:	I can’t go on.

Lt. M:	I know you are upset, but please try to continue.  It’s very important… now when did you realize that it was your husband?

Ms. G:	When I got out on the deck… I looked down over the railing… I was stunned… Eddie looked up at me and shook his head.  Then I could tell that it was Bob, and somehow I knew that he was… gone (sobbing).  I fell apart.  I couldn’t stand looking at him.  I went back inside… and stayed there until the ambulance came.  Eddie came up, and asked if there was anything he could do.  I think I asked him to call my sister.   Anyway she got here just before the ambulance.

Lt. M:	Marion, there was no wallet or identification on your husband.  Did he ordinarily carry a wallet?

Ms. G:	Yes, he always does.

Lt. M:	Did he carry a lot of money?

Ms. G:	Not a large amount.  Usually, no more than $50.

Lt. M:	Do you mind if we see if he left his wallet somewhere in the house on Saturday?

Ms. G:	No, go ahead.

Lt. M:	Thank you for your help Marion.  Take care.

[Lt. Moody and Marion Guion searched the house, but did not find the wallet.]

Eddie Sullivan
Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini’s (Sg. C) Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), The Handyman

Sg. C:	Mr. Sullivan, you said that you arrived at Mr. Guion’s about 6 Sat. morning.  You were tearing down a barn for him, I believe.

Ed. S: 	Yeah.. about 6… the sun was just coming up.  I like to get my work done early before it gets real hot.

Sg. C:	Did you notice anything unusual when you arrived?

Ed. S: 	No…  The light was on in Mr. Guion’s study, but that wasn’t unusual.  He is always up when I get there in the morning.  He was a hard worker.  He earned his money; it wasn’t given to him.

Sg. C:	How did you happen to notice Mr. Guion’s body?

Ed. S: 	I went back to my truck to get my crowbar.  I left it laying next to the truck.  When I got there, the crowbar was gone.  I looked around… that’s when I saw Mr. Guion laying in the grass through the breezeway.  At first, I thought it was Billy.. you know Billy… ah … Prentice, he cuts the grass on Saturdays.  He’s always there bright and early and I though maybe he had hurt himself.  Anyway, I ran back there.  I was shocked to see Mr. Guion.  I didn’t think he was even there ‘cause he plays golf on Saturday morning.  He leaves at 6:30, regular as clockwork, and is never back til about noon.

Sg. C:	OK, so you ran over to Mr. Guion…

Ed. S: 	Yeah, like I say I was shocked.  He looked real bad… blood on his head and laying there real awkward.  I ran up the stairs and pounded on the patio door.  I started to open it and then I saw Mrs. Guion coming in from the living room.  I though I shouldn’t alarm her too much so I just said, “Call an ambulance.  There’s been an accident.”  She started to run past me like she knew it was bad but I stopped her and said, “It’s alright, just call the ambulance.”  I never told her it was Mr. Guion.  I didn’t know he was dead til I got back down the stairs.

Sg. C:	Did you ever find the crowbar?

Ed. S: 	What?… Oh… no.  I never did.  I never looked again.  I was real upset.   I didn’t even go back to the barn.  I just left after the ambulance came.  By that time,  Mrs. Guions’ sister and her husband were there and I didn’t figure that I could do anything.

Sg. C:	You said at first you thought it was Billy Prentice lying there in the grass instead of Mr. Guion.  Was Billy there Saturday morning?

Ed. S: 	You know I don’t know…  come to think of it his car wasn’t there and none of the yard tools -- or the lawn mower -- was out.   But I though I heard his station wagon earlier.  

Sg. C:	When was that?

Ed. S: 	I can’t say for sure.  I just remember hearing a car with a loud muffler and thinking, “That’s Billy.”  None of Guion’s cars would ever sound like that.  I’d guess around 7.

Sg. C:	Did you hear anything else?  Did you hear anything like a fight or, perhaps, Mr. Guion falling?

Ed. S: 	No, can’t say as I did.  You know the barn is quite a piece from the house… probably 200 or 300 yards.  And there’s a woods between there too.
Eddie Sullivan

Sg. C:	You said you went back to pick up your crowbar by your truck.  Where was your truck?

Ed. S: 	It was in the carport beside Guion’s pickup.

Sg. C:	Why didn’t you drive it down to the barn where you were working?

Ed. S: 	Well… it had rained the night before, and I didn’t want to get it stuck down there.  There’s a gravel path but it’s not wide enough.  Besides Mr. Guion didn’t want me making ruts in the grass.

Sg. C:	Eddie, did you and Mr. Guion get along?

Ed. S: 	Yeah… I always like him… He was real fair when it came to business… paid well… easy to work for.

Sg. C:	Your daughter worked at Guion’s car dealership, didn’t she?  Did they get along?

Ed. S: 	Yeah… She was his bookkeeper for several years.  All of a sudden she quit.  I didn’t ask her about it.  She seemed upset, but I figured that that was their business.  You know what I mean?

Sg. C:	Sure, if you think of anything else that I should know, give me a call.  I’ll be in touch.



Mickey Malone
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt. M) Interview with 
Mickey Malone (M.M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M: 	Mr. Malone, I have to ask you some hard questions.  Its well known that you and Mr. Guion go back a long way but things were king of rough between the two of you lately.

M. M.:	We had some differences.

Lt. M: 	Did you call Mr. Guion Saturday morning?

M. M.:	Yes

Lt. M: 	Why?

M. M.:	Well… we always play golf with two other fellows on Saturday mornings… a foursome, you know.  Well… the last 2 weeks things had been awkward… downright nasty at times.  I told him we either put this thing behind us or else… or else either he or I should drop out of the foursome. It just wasn’t fair to the other… to ruin their golf.

Lt. M: 	The other 2… Rick Rooney and Jim Townsend, I believe.

M. M.:	Yeah.  Anyways, I wanted to clear thing up before we got to the country club.

Lt. M: 	You play at Mountain View?

M. M.:	Yeah.

Lt. M: 	What did Mr. Guion say when you called him?

M. M.:	Bob told me to stuff it.  I told him, “If you’re playing golf, I’m not!”  He said, “Fine, do what you want.”

Lt. M: 	What did you do?

M. M.:	My first impulse was to drive over to his place and work this out face-to-face.  I go to the Crestview turnoff and thought to myself, “This is silly.  We’ll just end up fighting.”  I turned back.. stopped at a coffee ship across from Eastwood… there on 160th.  I thought about it some more and decide to go play golf.  Just ‘cause Bob wanted to be a horse’s rear didn’t mean I had to ruin my day.

Lt. M: 	What time did you leave home?

M. M.:	6:20.. 6:30… I don’t know… somewhere around then.

Lt. M: 	How long does it take to get to Crestview from your house?

M. M.:	I don’t know.  Maybe… it’s about a mile north of Meadowland… that’s about 9 miles then… probably 15 minutes

Lt. M: 	How long were you at the café?

M. M.:	I don’t recall for sure.  Why?  What does it matter anyway?


Mickey Malone

Lt. M: 	Mr. Malone, you and Mr. Guion were not on the best of terms.  To be honest, we don’t know what happened last Saturday morning but its clear that there was foul play.  We are just following all leads.  If you don’t want to answer my questions, you don’t have to… at least, not right now.

M. M.:	I really don’t know.  As I remember, I drank 2 cups of coffee and then left… maybe 10 minutes.

Lt. M: 	You went to the golf course straight from the café?

M. M.:	Right.

Lt. M: 	It’s about 5 miles from Eastwood to Mountain View golf course?

M. M.:	Yeah… about.

Lt. M: 	So you left home somewhere around 6:20 or 6:30.  Fifteen minutes to Crestwiew; a couple of minutes back to the café, let’s say; 10 or so minutes of coffee drinking; and say another 8 minutes to Mountain View… Let’s see… That should have put you at the golf course around 7, give or take 5 minutes.  Is that about right?

M. M.:	Sounds right.. yeah, I got there right at 7; that’s when we always meet.

Lt. M: 	You did not go to Guion’s place on Saturday morning?

M. M.:	No, I didn’t.

Lt. M: 	Thanks, Mr. Malone, for your time.

Billy Prentice
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt.M) interview with
Billy Prentice (B.P.), Guion’s Yardman

Lt. M:	Billy, I need to talk to you about Mr. Guion’s death.  You did hear about it didn’t you?

B. P.:	Yes, sir.  It was awful, wasn’t it?

Lt. M:	Yeah, too bad.  Were you at Mr. Guion’s place on Saturday morning?

B. P.:	No, sir.

Lt. M:	Don’t you usually cut the grass on Saturday?

B. P.:	Yes, sir… usually…, but not last Saturday.

Lt. M:	Why not?

B. P.:	Ah.. I just cut it the week before.

Lt. M:	But this time of year.. don’t you usually cut it every week?

B. P.:	Yeah, but … I wasn’t feeling good last Saturday morning. Besides it rained Friday night and the grass was probably wet.

Lt. M:	But I mowed my grass last Saturday morning.  By 9:30, the sun had dried the grass out.  Remember, it was clear and hot.  Didn’t it occur to you that the grass would be dry later in the morning?

B. P.:	I guess so… but by then I figured I wouldn’t have time to get it done before my ball game.

Lt. M:	Billy, what time was your ball game?

B. P.:	Noon.

Lt. M:	How long does it usually take you to cut the grass?

B. P.:	A couple of hours, but I had other things I needed to do out there.

Lt. M:	Couldn’t you have done those other things while the grass was drying and still been able to make it to your ball game?

B. P.:	I suppose so… l don’t know… I like to get to the game early… Besides I said I wasn’t feeling so good in the morning.

Lt. M:	Billy, I should tell you right out… Mr. Sullivan… You know Mr. Sullivan don’t you?

B. P.:	You mean Eddie, the carpenter?  Yes, sir, I know him.

Lt. M:	Well, Mr. Sullivan heard your car at Guion’s on Saturday morning.  How do you explain that?

B. P.:	How’d he know it was my car?  When?

Lt. M:	He just said that he heard your car about 7 Saturday morning.  He said that he recognized the loud muffler.
Billy Prentice

B. P.:	No, he couldn’t have.  I wasn’t there at 7 on Saturday.

Lt. M:	Billy, come one.  We know that your car was at Guion’s place.  We picked up fresh tire tracks along the edge of the gravel near the carport.  They match your tires, Billy, and we know they weren’t a week old.

B. P.:	OK… OK… I was there Friday to ask Mr. Guion for an advance.  I was a little short on money.  He gave it to me.

Lt. M:	What time on Friday?

B. P.:	Around 4:00, just before ball practice.  I was broke and he always helps me out.

Lt. M:	So you borrow money a lot?  What do you need the money for?

B. P.:	Ah… yeah, I suppose so… for my car.  I work on my car a lot, fixing it up, keeping it in good shape.

Lt. M:	OK, Billy, that’s all for now.  We’ll talk later.

B. P.:	Sir,… you know I didn’t hit Mr. Guion… You know I wouldn’t hurt him… He was always good to me.

Lt. M:	Sure, Billy, I know… See you around.

Rick Rooney
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt. M) Interview with
Rick Rooney (R.R.), Guion’s and Malone’s Golf Partner

Lt. M.:	I’d like to ask some questions about Mickey Malone.

R. R.:	I’ll be glad to help if I can.

Lt. M.:	You play golf with Mr. Malone on Saturday morning.  Right?

R. R.:	Yes, I do.  We have a regular foursome.

Lt. M.:	Can you tell me anything about his relationship with Mr. Guion?

R. R.:	They were always good friends… until these last few weeks.  They had some sort of business disagreement.  Mickey wouldn’t say a whole lot about it, though.  They’ve had problems in the past, but it’s never been this bad.

Item 61 	Lt. M.:	What time did Mr. Malone arrive at the golf course last Saturday?

R. R.:	Around 7 as usual.

Lt. M.:	Ok, I appreciate your help.
Dave Daniels
Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini’s (Sg. C) Interview with
Dave Daniels (D. D.), Owner of Dave’s Quick Stop
In the Eastwood Shopping Center

Sg. C:	Dave, when you called Saturday morning, you said that you found a wallet behind your store.  Where did you find it?

D. D.:	It was lying beside the dumpster in the back… next to some boxes that I had stacked out there.

Sg. C:	What did the wallet look like?

D. D.:	It was a nice one.  It looked new… and expensive… so I thought it was strange that someone would throw it away.

Sg. C:	Did it have any money in it?

D. D.:	No, in fact it was empty.  All that I found were Mr. Guion’s credit cards inside the dumpster.

Sg. C:	You never found any money or a driver’s license?

D. D.:	No, just 3 credit cards.

Item 62 Sg. C:	What time did you find the wallet?

D. D.:	Probably about 7 AM.  Yeah, I remember because I got to the store just before 7 and was checking some stock in the back room right before I found the wallet.

Sg. C:	What made you go outside?

D. D.:	I heard a car pull up in back and then speed away.  I went out to see what was going on but the car was gone by the time I got out there.  That’s when I saw the wallet.

Item 43 Sg. C:	So you heard a car right before you went out and saw the wallet.  Are you sure it was a car?

D. D.:	No… not really.  I assumed it was a car because it ran real quiet.  I probably wouldn’t have heard it but the tires squealed when it left.  Like I say, I didn’t see it.

Sg. C:	Could it have been a pickup?

D. D.:	I suppose so.

Sg. C:	Are you sure the wallet wasn’t there earlier?

D. D.:	Pretty sure, I walked right past there when I came in just a little earlier and I don’t know how I would have missed it if it was there.

Sg. C:	Thanks, Dave.  If you think of anything else, call me.

Sam Nietzel
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt. M) Interview with
Sam Nietzel (S. N.), Parts Manager for Guion Lincoln/Mercury

Lt. M:	Mr. Nietzel, I need to ask you some question in regards to Guion’s connection with MM Auto parts.  Were Guion and Malone having difficulties?

S. N.:	Yes, I suppose so.  We’ve done business with Malone for years.  In fact, he started supplying parts for us when he was still operating out of the barn on the old Malone place.

Lt. M:	I’ve heard that Malone got his real start by being a supplier for Guion and they were friends for years.

S. N.:	Yes, that’s right… They’ve been friends way back… but they had their ups and downs… They always worked things out before… until this last thing.  It seems that Malone started giving Guion substandard parts, which really steamed Bob because he is very concerned about giving his customers quality service.   He even told me to stop ordering from Malone.

Lt. M:	What was wrong with the parts?

S. N.:	Well, some of them didn’t fit; some seemed to wear out and break easily.  My guess is that they were either rebuilt or after market parts.

Lt. M:	When did you realize this was going on?

S. N.:	About 2 months ago… It’s been a mess around here since.

Lt. M:	So would you like to go back to MM Parts?

S. N.:	No, and I especially wouldn’t do it without Mr. Guion’s OK.  And he was dead set against it.. Wouldn’t even talk about it!  Mr. Guion was a proud and stubborn man.

Lt. M:	Another matter… Do you know anything about Ms. Sullivan’s leaving the firm?

S. N.:	That would be Sue Sullivan, the bookkeeper?

Lt. M:	Yes, Sue Sullivan.

S. N.:	No, I don’t really know anything in particular?

Item 11	Lt. M:	Nothing out of the ordinary happened before she left?

S. N.:	Well, maybe… I didn’t know there was a problem until I overheard them arguing in his office.  I didn’t mean to hear, but I couldn’t help it.  I was going in the talk to Mr. Guion about something.  Next thing I knew she was leaving… I mean leaving for good, packing up her things.

Lt. M:	Did you hear what they were arguing about?

S. N.:	No, they sounded real mad, but I couldn’t make out what they were saying… They stopped when they saw me coming.

Lt. M:	Had they argued like that before?

Sam Nietzel

S. N.:	No, not that I know of.  They always seemed to get along real well.  Maybe it was… well, I don’t know.

Lt. M:	Do you know if Mr. Guion had any enemies or dissatisfied customers?

S. N.:	Not really.  Mr. Guion treated his customers like royalty.  He always said, “The customer is always right… always!”  He not only said it, he lived by it.

Lt. M:	Thanks, Sam, for your time.  If you think of anything else, give me a call.  You’ve been a great help.

S. N.:	Glad to be… Want to get this mess sorted out.

Item 63  Millie Smith
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt.M) Interview with 
Millie Smith (M.S.), a waitress at Ray’s Café

Lt. M:	I’d like to ask you a few questions if you don’t mind.

M. S.:	Sure.  What can I do for you?

Lt. M:	Were you working here last Saturday?

M. S.:	Yes, I was.  The morning shift.

Lt. M:	So you would have been here at 7 in the morning?

M. S.:	Yes, I was covering the counter and the cash register.

Lt. M:	Do you remember seeing this man in here last Saturday?
[He shows her a picture of Mickey Malone.]

M. S.:	Hmm… yes, as a matter of fact, I do.  He came in early; I’d guess around 6:30 or 6:45.  Somewhere around then, shortly after I got here.  Ordinarily I wouldn’t remember him because we get a lot of one-time traffic from the freeway and I know he’s not a regular.  But I do remember because he just sat there and drank 2 cups of coffee rather quickly and then left all of a sudden - - like he was late for something.  He didn’t even wait for his bill.  He just left 2 dollars on the counter.  I remember thinking, “I wish everyone would tip like that for a cup of coffee.”

Lt. M:	How long was he here?

M. S.:	Not very long… maybe 10 minutes, 15 minutes at most.

Lt. M:	Can you tell me anything else about him?  You said he seemed in a hurry.  Did you notice anything else unusual?

M. S.:	No, I wasn’t paying that much attention to him.  We were pretty busy at the time.

Lt. M:	OK, thanks for your time.  Here’s 2 dollars for the coffee.  See Malone isn’t the only big tipper.  We cops appreciated service with a smile, too.

Marion Guion – Second Interview
Excerpts from
Lt. Moody’s (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with 
Marion Guion (Ms. G), wife of Robert Guion

Lt. M:	Marion, I need your help to clear up a couple of matters if you don’t mind.

Ms. G:	Sure.

Item 41	Lt. M:	Billy Prentice claims that he came by on Friday to ask your husband for an advance.  Do you know anything about this?

Ms. G:	Why… yes, he did come by… in the afternoon, I believe.

Lt. M:	Did your husband give him any money?

Ms. G:	Yes, he did.  I’m not sure how much, but I remember he said, kind of jokingly, “I wonder if I’ll ever get to pay Billy AFTER he does the work.”

Lt. M:	Do you know exactly what time it was on Friday when he came by?

Ms. G:	No, I’d only be guessing… late afternoon, I’d say.

Lt. M:	Billy Prentice seems to have problems handling his money.  Does he borrow… or ask for advances on his wages… often?

Ms. G:	Yes… quite often.

Lt. M:	Do you have any idea what he uses the money for?

Ms. G:	Well… I’m not sure, but I think he has been involved with gambling.

Lt. M:	What made you say that?

Ms. G:	Well, I know he plays poker with some friends of his, and Bob and I ran into him once at the racetrack.  We’ve only been there a few times, but I always like to go just to watch the horses.  I think they’re beautiful.  Anyway, Bob and I never bet more than a few dollars.  But when we saw Billy there, he had quite a stack of betting slips in his hand.  He noticed us just then and seemed really nervous and quickly walked away from the betting window.  After this incident, Bob said he would keep an eye on Billy.

Lt. M:	How long ago did this happen?

Ms. G:	Hmm… about… it was soon after he started working for us.  Probably 2 years ago.

Lt. M:	One other thing, was Billy here anytime on Saturday morning?

Ms. G:	No, I can’t say that he was, come to think of it.  I guess with everything else I never gave it a thought, but he didn’t show up… At least, he never mowed the lawn.

Item 13 Lt. M:	As I recall, you heard a car on the gravel out front about 6:40.  You thought at the time that it was your husband driving away.  Could it have been Billy or someone else driving up the drive?

Marion Guion – Second Interview 

Ms. G:	Maybe… but, no.  It couldn’t have been anyone driving up… If it had been, it seems that I would have seen them.  The only thing that I saw was Bob’s pickup in the carport… nothing else.  

Lt. M:	Did Mickey Malone come by anytime Saturday?

Ms. G:	No… I don’t think so… Melissa, Mickey’s wife, called early Saturday afternoon.  She said that they had just heard on the radio and wanted to know if there was anything that they could do.

Lt. M:	They didn’t come over at any time?

Ms. G:	Not on Saturday.  They stopped by briefly on Sunday to offer their condolences.

Item 12 Lt. M:	One other matter… Is it true that Eddie Sullivan has a hearing problem?

Ms. G:	Yes, he is very hard of hearing.  Sometimes when he gets a phone call, I have to call him.  I’ve tried calling to him from the deck, but he never hears me.  I have to walk right up to him before I can get his attention.

Lt. M:	Doesn’t he have a hearing aid?

Ms. G:	He has one, but he doesn’t wear it while he is working.  He says that it doesn’t fit well.  It’s one of those tiny ones and he’s afraid he will lose it. 

Lt. M:	I think that’s all, Marion.  Thanks for your patience.  I hope I don’t have to bother you again with these details.

Billy Prentice – 2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini’s (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with 
Billy Prentice (B. P.), Guion’s Yardman

Sg. C:	Billy, since you talked with Lt. Moody, some new things have come up.  I remind you, Billy, that you don’t have to answer my questions if you don’t want to.

B. P.:	Sir, I don’t mind.  I have nothing to hide.

Sg. C:	Very well.  You said that you went to Guion’s on Friday night, not Saturday morning… Right?

B. P.:	Yes Sir… Well, actually I went there Friday afternoon, not Friday night.

Sg. C:	To borrow some money, I think you said.

B. P.:	Yes, that’s right.

Sg. C:	Was this money to pay off gambling debts, Billy?

B. P.:	No! No, sir!

Sg. C:	Is it true that you are an excessive gambler?

B. P.:	No!  I mean.. well, I gamble as much as the next guy… you know, poker with the boys… racetrack every now and then.  I used to do it a lot more a couple years back, but I’ve really cut down.  I don’t have a problem with it sir… really!

Sg. C:	OK, so you were there on Friday and not on Saturday?

B. P.:	Yes, sir, that ‘s what I said!

T Sg. C:	Those tire tracks that Lt. Moody told you about… Billy, those tracks were almost certainly made after Friday night’s rain.  And, as you know, it rained from about 10 to midnight.

B. P.:	But… [long pause]… I…

Sg. C:	Billy are you sure that there is nothing that you want to tell me?

B. P.:	Alright, sir… I was there… I went to do some work.  I saw Mr. Guion just laying there.  I want over to him.  It was awful.

Sg. C:	Billy, why didn’t you say something before?

B. P.:	Nobody’s going to believe me.  I thought I’d just better get out of there and act like I didn’t know nothing.

Sg. C:	So you ran.

B. P.:	I sure did.  I almost hit Mr. Sullivan’s truck when I was pulling out of the carport.  I couldn’t get out of there fast enough.  I swerved… that’s probably when I went off the road.

Sg. C:	While you were at Guion’s did you see a crowbar?

B. P.:	What?  A crowbar? .. Yeah, I did now that you mention it.
Billy Prentice – 2nd Interview

Item 42 Sg. C:	Where did you see it?

B. P.:	It was laying in front of the garage door, the side door where I get the mower out.  I remember moving it to the side so I could get the mower out.

Sg. C:	That’s all?  You just moved it over to the side?

B. P.:	Yes, sir.

Sg. C:	Anything else you remember about that?

B. P.:	Well, I remember thinking that it must be Mr. Sullivan’s ‘cause Mr. Guion didn’t have any tools to speak of around the place… excepting some garden tools.  But then I thought that that was odd ‘cause Mr. Sullivan always makes this big thing about keeping his tools locked up when he’s not around.  And I didn’t see him anywhere… just his truck.

Sg. C:	Billy, the crowbar was found in the bushes south of the garage… with your fingerprints on it.  Can you explain that?

B. P.:	No, Sarg, I swear… I did pick it up, why would I throw it in the bushes?

Sg. C:	That’s what I’d like to know… OK, let’s go on.  What time would you say that you were at Guion’s on Saturday?

B. P.:	I don’t rightly recall.  I was late.  Maybe 8, I’d guess.  Like I said, I wasn’t feeling so good.

Sg. C:	Did you take Mr. Guion’s billfold?

B. P.:	No, sir.  You gotta believe me.  When I saw he was dead, I just go tout of there!

Sg. C:	How did you know that he was dead?

B. P.:	I don’t know… He looked dead… He didn’t move when I yelled… he wasn’t laying there natural like.

Sg. C:	Did you go over to him?  Did you check his pulse?  Didn’t you even try to get help?  Maybe call Mrs. Guion or something?

B. P.:	No, I just got out of there.  I didn’t think there was anything I could do.

Sg. C:	Okay, thanks Billy.  That’ll be all for now.


Eddie Sullivan – 2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Sgt. Cassini’s (Sg. C) Follow-up Interview with
Eddie Sullivan (Ed. S), the Handyman

Sg. C.:	Eddie, since we last talked we found your crowbar in the bushes south of Guion’s garage.  At least, we think it’s yours: it has “ES” stamped on it.

Ed. S.:	Yeah, all of my tools are stamped.  You can’t be too careful.  They borrow them and forget they’re yours.  You know what I mean?

Sg. C.:	Do you have any idea how it got in the bushes?

Ed. S.:	No… Can’t say as I do.

Sg. C.:	We’re trying to get some things about last Saturday sorted out.  You said you got to the Guion’s about 6 in the morning and went straight to the barn.  Then about 7 you heard a car… with a loud muffler.  Mrs. Guion thought you came to the patio door around 10:30.  Is that about the time that you discovered Mr. Guion’s body?

Ed. S.:	I’m not sure about that.  It could have been around then.  I really don’t remember.

Sg. C.:	OK, Eddie, if you think of anything else, give me a call.

Mickey Malone – 2nd Interview

Excerpts from
Lt. Mood’s (Lt. M) Follow-up Interview with
Mickey Malone (M. M.), owner of MM Auto Parts

Lt. M.:	Mr. Malone, I need to double check some things that you told me the other day.  You said you left home about 6:20 or 6:30 with the idea of going to Mr. Guion’s house to talk to him.

M. M.:	That’s right.

Lt. M.:	But you never actually went to his place, rather you stopped for coffee.

M. M.:	Yes

Lt. M.:	So you were at the café about 10 minutes, I believe you said.  And then you went to the golf course, arrived there around 7.

M. M.:	Yeah.

Lt. M.:	You said that you had made overtures to Mr. Guion, wanted to clear things up.

M. M.:	That’s right, but he’s been so hard headed.

Lt. M.:	Well, is it true that you gave defective parts to Mr. Guion?

M. M.:	My auto parts are of respectable quality as far as I know.  If Bob had any problems with the parts I gave him, it wasn’t my doing.

Lt. M.:	Did he write this note to you?

[Copy of note on following page.]

M. M.:	Ah, yeah, he did.  When I read that he was going to ruin my business with other customers, I offered him the best terms I could.  I was even willing to sell him parts at cost to try and patch things up.  I mean… if I lost the business, I don’t know what I would do.  But he can be so stubborn.  So I called him Saturday morning.  I just though it was time to work this out, one on one.

Lt. M.:	When did you receive the note?

M. M.:	A week ago Monday, I think.

Lt. M.:	I see.  OK, Mr. Malone, that’s all for now.


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions, with the following con-straints: 
> (a) Participants were assigned to groups to maximize the num-ber of 3- and 6-person groups in each experimental session 
>  (b)groups were assigned to experimental conditions so that the number ineach cell of the design was approximately equal at all times
2. Participants met in a large room at the beginning of the session.Preliminary instructions stated that the research was interested in how groups use information to make decisions. After the introduction, the instructions varied depending on the task set condition. 
3. Participants individually read and reviewed the interviews for approximately 30 min. They then completed a private, prediscussion questionnaire. On this questionnaire, participants in the solve conditions indicated which of the three suspects they thought was guilty whereas participants in the judge conditions ranked the three suspects from most to least likely of being guilty
> In 3-person groups, each member received only three of the critical clues: one incriminating clue about E, one exonerating clue about M, and one exonerating clue about B. Nonetheless, the 3 members collectively had all of the information. For the 6-person groups in the hidden profile conditions, 3 group members received the same pattern of critical clues as described earlier for 3-person groups. The other 3 members in the 6-person groupreceived only the shared information and none of the critical clues.
4. In the second part of the session, groups met in adjacent rooms todiscuss the suspects. 
> In the judge conditions, groups were instructed to decide on a ranking of the suspects from most to least likely of having committed the crime. 
> In the solve conditions, they were told to decide which one of the three suspects was guilty. 
5. All groups were given up to 30 min to reach decisions but could end their discussion whenever they reached unanimous agreement.After discussion ended, participants rated the sufficiency of the available information for determining who was the guilty suspect.


## Instructions
Judge Condition: The detectives in the case do not have sufficientevidence to charge anybody for the homicide. . . we are asking you to use the available evidence and decide which of the suspects seems mos tlikely to have committed the crime." 

Solve Condition:,". . . only one of the suspects could have committed the crime. We would like you to read over the materials carefully and to decide who you think committed the crime."

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Pre-Discussion Choices: Researchers evaluted how people responded to the prediscussion questionnaire based on information conditions. The proportion oftimes that Suspect E (the "correct" choice) was chosen as guilty(solve task set) or "most likely to have committed the crime"(judge task set) was analyzed in a 2 (group size: 3 vs. 6) X 2 (taskset: solve vs. judge) X 2 (prediscussion information distribu-tion: all shared vs. hidden profile) log-linear analysis

Discussion Choices: Groups in the solve set conditions decided which suspect was guilty, whereas groups in the judge set conditions decided which suspect was most likely to have committed the crime.F As with prediscussion preferences, they then analyze the group decision data in a 2 (group size) X2 (task set) X 2 (prediscussion information distribution) log-lin-ear analysis.

Discussion Content: Two coders listened to audio recordings of each group discussion and noted each time a clue or fact was mentioned.During coding, items were not distinguished as being critical ornoncritical clues or details; coders merely recorded a code associated with an item of information when it was mentioned during discussion.
> 24 total clues,9 were critical for demonstratingthat Suspect E committed the crime, whereas Suspects M and B did not. 
> In the subsequent analyses, we refer to these 9 as the critical clues. 
> The remaining 15 clues that collectively tended toimplicate the wrong suspects (M and B) are called the noncritical clues. 
> In addition, there were 32 facts that provided background information that are known as details
