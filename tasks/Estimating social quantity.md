# Procedure
## Steps
### Pre-surveys

1. Individuals completed the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT), a 50-item measure that is widely used for assessing individual intelligence.

2. Individuals completed the the NEO Five Factor Inventory. 

3. Individuals completed a RME (Readoing the Mind in Eyes) test

4. Individuals were sorted into groups of 2-5

### Task

Groups were given a set of 20 items requiring estimation of a quantity (e.g., "What was the median age in the U.S. in 2009?") and had 10 minutes to answer as many as possible. 

### Post-surveys

Group satisfaction was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as: 'I have been
very satisfied working on this team' on a five-point scale.

Motivation was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as 'I would feel bad and
unhappy if our team has performed poorly' (reverse-scored) on a five-point scale.

Social cohesiveness was measured: Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as 'Members of this group would
enjoy being at a party together' on a five-point scale. 

Psychological safety was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as 'It is difficult to
ask other members of this team for help' on a five-point scale.


## Instructions

1. Participants were instructed to individually complete personality tests

2. Participants were instructed to answer as many estimation questions as possible (out of 20) in a group within 10 minutes

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Groups were scored based on the absolute percent deviation of their estimate from the correct answer.  

## Incentives

Participants were paid for participating.
