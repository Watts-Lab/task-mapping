# Procedure
## Steps
Phase One:
1200 participants completed 5 room tasks (three 'very low' and two 'moderate' complexity tasks) and a standard 'Reading the Mind' in the Eyes (RME) test.

The task required to assign N 'students' to M 'rooms' so as to maximize the total utility of the students, each of who has a specified utility for each room, while also respecting Q constraints.

High complexity: Assign 9 students to 6 rooms given 8 constraints

Low complexity: Assign 6 students to 4 rooms given 2 constraints

In each room assignment problem, a 'utility table' was presented, providing participant(s) with the information on students’ ratings/preferences (between 0 and 100) to each of the M rooms indicating how satisfied they would be if being assigned to the room.

At any time during the allotted 5-minute period for a task, the participant could push a button to submit her solution and move on to the next task, or the participant would be automatically redirected to the next task when the 5-minute timer was up

Phase Two: 
Teams of 3 participants were randomly constructed and tasked to complete 5 more room tasks (task sequence is randomized) varying in very low, low, moderate, high, and very high complexity, with all tasks timing out at 10 mins.

Based on each individual's score in task one, they were categorized into blocks by skill level and social perceptiveness (HH, MH, LH, HL, ML, LL) 

Within these categories, the participants were then separated either into groups, or remained individual.

When the task is performed in groups then:

* All participants can do the assignment simultaneously, however, ony one
  student can be moved by one player at any given time (i.e., locking the
  student being moved, but the others are free to be moved).
* Participants can chat freely using the in-experiment chatting system.
* All events (i.e., which student being assigned to which room etc) will be
  logged and announced in the experiment as they happen.
* All group members had to agree on the placements before moving on, or the task would continue automatically after 10 minutes.

## Roles 
Phase two groups were categorized into blocks (HH, MH, LH, HL, ML, LL)
HH: High skill, high social perceptiveness

MH: Mixed high/low skill, high social perceptiveness

LH: Low skill, high social perceptiveness

HL: High skill, low social perceptiveness

ML: Mixed high/low skill, low social perceptiveness

LL: Low skill, low social perceptiveness

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Phase One:
Performance was calculated by looking at skill, social perceptiveness, and cognitive style.
* Ability: measured by the performance in the game.
* Social Perceptiveness (SP): Measured through RME test.
* Cognitive Style (CS): an in-task measure of problem-solving style (e.g.,intuitive versus analytical).

Phase Two:
Performance was calculated by considering the normalized score the individual or group obtained on this task, defined as score on task T/ max score for task T.

Duration (or time to completion) was measured as the time elapsed from the start of the task until a solution is submitted

Efficiency was measured as normalized score/ duration.

## Incentives
Overall scores were defined as the sum of students’ ratings of their assigned rooms - 100 * the number of violated constraints

If each student got assigned to one room and the participant had a positive score, participant(s) could earn a “performance-based bonus” using a 500 points:$1 USD conversion rate in phase one, and a 1000 points:$1 USD conversion rate in phase two. 

If the submitted plan was indeed the optimal one, an additional $0.5 USD “optimal assignment bonus” would be given.
