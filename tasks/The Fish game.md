# Summary
This task works to use collective sensing in groups of fish in order to better understand collective intelligence in human groups. To do this, individuals participated in a gradient-sensing task in which every location in this virtual world responded to a score value that changed over time.

These score fields consisted of 480 × 285 arrays of score values for each 125ms time interval in our game. First, a “spotlight” of high value was created that moved in straight paths between uniformly randomly chosen locations. This spotlight was then combined with a field of spatially correlated noise. This procedure yields a complex landscape with many transient maxima and a single persistent time-varying global maximum.

 Participants could only see the scores at their avatars' locations
 
 They could also see the positions, directions, and speeds of all other players
 
 Players controlled their avatars using the left and right arrow keys to turn and could hold the space bar to accelerate

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
The weighting between the noise field and the spotlight were manipulated to generate different task conditions which corresponded to “low” and “medium” noise levels 

# Procedure
## Steps
 Participants either played alone or in groups from 2-6.
 
 After agreeing to participate, participants were presented with a set of instructions. 
  These instructions described the mechanics of the game
  
 The participants were not informed about the nature of the underlying score fields and were not encouraged to work together
 
 Participants completed a comprehension test
 
 Participants were put into a waiting room for up to five minutes or until a pre-assigned number of other players joined the game
  While in the waiting room, participants could familiarize themselves with the controls of the game. Players were not shown any score in the waiting room unless the participant was against a wall, in which case the displayed score would change from a dashed line to a red “0%”.
 
 Each participant played in a single game for 6 minutes


## Roles 
Participants had the same role

## Instructions
ASKED AND WAITING RESPONSE

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
 The score of a player at a particular point in time was simply determined by the location of that player in the virtual world, which parallels the fishes’ preferences for darker areas in their environment.
 
 To discourage inactivity, players were awarded a score of zero if their avatars were touching a wall

## Incentives
Participants were paid 50 cents for reading the instructions, and could receive a bonus of up to $1.25 during the six minutes of gameplay
 These bonuses were the players' cumulative scores divided by the total length of the game times the total possible bonus

They were also paid 12 cents per minute for any time spend in the waiting room, minus any time that player spent against a wall
