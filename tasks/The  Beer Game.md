# Summary
The beer game is an exercise that simulates the material and information flows in a production distribution system. It has four players: retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and factory. Customer demand (in kegs of beer) arises at the retailer, which replenishes its inventory from the wholesaler, the wholesaler from the distributor, and the distributor from the factory. In each period, the channel members must decide how much, if any, to order from their respective suppliers and the factory must decide how much, if any, to produce.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. To facilitate quick preparation at the facility, pre-assemble “kits” for each game board that includes pennies, demand cards, colored order pads, and two order forms for each position with initial demand already written on them. This enables a complete game board to be setup in less
than two minutes. Thus, a team of 10 TAs can setup 100 boards in approximately 15-20 minutes.
2. Once the doors open, remind participants to find their group and sit at any game board. 
3. At the official start time, reallocate any incomplete groups (i.e. including students who will be late or absent) into full groups of four. We also reserve a few game boards near the entrance for a “late arrivals section” to minimize disruption during the instructions. 
4. Using PowerPoint slides, we then introduce the game board structure and the goal of the game, telling students to, “minimize your inventory costs by managing your Current Inventory‟ box”. 
5. After watching one complete round of step-by-step instructions, the instructions are repeated while students follow along for two more rounds before allowing the teams to play on their own.
> Although the game can be conducted with the instructor leading students through each step of each round, we allow the groups to play at their own pace after guiding them through the first two rounds, which is similar to Coakley et al.‟s approach.
6. Following this “training” which typically takes approximately 20 minutes, the steps are listed on the screen for students to reference as needed. Most issues subside within another 20 minutes as participants understand how to play. 
7. Our games cease after 36 rounds to eliminate horizon effects. We enable this by placing a “stop card” as the 37th customer demand card. The card instructs the group to raise their hands, at which point a TA arrives and provides a summary template “cover page” for the group to attach to their graphs and tracking sheets. This template requires participants to fill in their names for attendance tracking purposes and their individual inventory costs for comparison purposes during the debrief session. 
8. During the debrief, We start the session with a “pictures and comments” PowerPoint presentation that combines the most entertaining and honest comments from the template cover page submissions with various game board photos taken during the exercise in a time-lapsed approach that provides an entertaining illustration of the bullwhip effect occurring to the supply chain. Next, we show the average results by position from the MIT students and the selected graphs for benchmarking purposes.

## Roles
A supply chain consisting of four stations: a factory, a distribution center, a warehouse,
and a retail store. Material flows from upstream to downstream (i.e. from the factory to the distribution center, then to the warehouse, and finally to the retail store), while information in the form of replenishment orders flows in the opposite direction
