# Summary
Participants were organized into groups of four and performed a series of tasks in a series of rounds with old and new group members, in some rounds team member names were visible (unmasked) while other rounds they were not (masked). Teams were given $500,000 and had to allocate funds between a number of competing programs which were each designed to appeal to particular personal values.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants assigned to task group- the teams were allocated based on social golfer matching, so that each collaboration consists of members who have never interacted before
2. Participants play four rounds of that task (order balanced across groups: 2 with same group, two with new group). At the end of the round, the team collectively
decided on a final allocation and a statement of their reasoning and one member submitted it on behalf of the team. The programs’ options were rotated such that each round contained a new set of options and a new combination of values
3. At the end of each round participants complete a viability scale
4. At the end of all rounds participants attitudinal data collected

## Instructions
1. DO NOT REFRESH OR LEAVE THE PAGE! If you do, it may terminate the task for your team members and you will not be compensated.
2. You will receive the bonus pay at the stated hourly rate only if you fill out all survey questions and complete all rounds.
3. The entire HIT will take no more than 45 minutes total.
4. Task: You must evaluate competing requests for funding and make judgements about their relative merit. Many programs have merit, but limited resources require that you select the programs that you prefer to fund. You have discretionary funds available, and a number of projects are requesting access to these funds.
    Your group’s job is to select those that should receive support.
    Your personal goal in selecting projects for funding is to choose those programs that agree with your personal values.
5. You have $500,000 total to allocate from this fund.
Proposals received from various organizations for projects are listed below. Each project is in need of $500,000 but can benefit from any contribution that you might make. The greater the contribution that you make to a particular project, the more likely it is that the chosen project will succeed.
6. Proposed projects:
    > 1. To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.
    > 2. To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.
    > 3. To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.
7. You have 10 minutes to complete this decision as a group.
After everyone is done reading, begin discussing with your group members to agree on a final allocation. When prompted, enter the final choices and the reasons behind them.
There is, of course, no optimal allocation. However, your group’s performance will be evaluated by judges based on how persuasive your arguments for the allocation are.
8. You’re about half way through this round.
As a reminder, you’re deciding on how to allocate $500,000 between the following initiatives based on which programs agree with your personal values:
    > 1. To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.
    > 2. To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.
    > 3. To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.
9. Get ready to submit your group decision.
10. The programs you are considering are:
    > 1. To purchase a new computer system for the county government in order to hold local taxes constant.
    > 2. To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults.
    > 3. To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.
11. Submit the team’s final choices by sending a message for each program starting with its number in the list above as well as the amount of money allocated and the main reason. Use this format:
    > 1. $$$ reason
    > 2. $$$ reason
    > 3. $$$ reason
12. Last chance to submit!
13. This round is ending soon. Time to say goodbye to your teammates!

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Team Fracture: 
Associated with low average team viability scores: at the end of each round, each participant filled out a 14-item viability scale drawn from prior work

Attitudinal data: when at least half of a group’s members privately excluded that group from future rounds

## Incentives
Participants were paid $12 per hour for taking part in the experiment, and were incentivized to complete the entire study by receiving a majority of their payment as a bonus at the end of the experiment.
