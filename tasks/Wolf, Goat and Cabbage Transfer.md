# Stimuli

## Visual Components/description

A potentially effective visual (especially when showing the task to children) could be a cartoon with 3 frames. In each frame and on each side of the river the allowed and not allowed combinations of the stimuli (animals) could be shown. There are only 3 choose 2 *illegal* options and this would help make sure participants understand the task.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
There are other cosmetic variations of the puzzle also exist, such as: wolf, sheep, and cabbage; fox, chicken, and grain;fox, goose and corn;and panther, pig, and porridge. The logic of the puzzle, in which there are three objects, A, B, and C, such that neither A and B nor B and C can be left together, remains the same.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are assigned to groups of four
2. Participants are given time to read the prompt 
3. They moved immediately into trial-and-error exploration, which began in the pursuit of two ideas, within the context of their professed intention to explore the possibility of solving a part of the problem – i.e., bringing one of the items to the other side of the river. 

## Instructions

Please read the following problem and determine possible solutions: 

Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.

If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.

The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?
