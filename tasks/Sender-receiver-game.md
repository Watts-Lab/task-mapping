# Summary
A sender-receiver game (AKA signaling game) is a communication-based game where one player sends a message to another who then chooses an action which determines the payoff. The payoffs are asymmetric (one player always receives more than the other) and this type of task is used to study deception. This version of the game is known as a “cheap talk” game, meaning that it does not cost a participant more to lie.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
There are no other visual components other than the instructions shown to participants.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Would it be worthwhile to include other signaling games (ie ones with trade-offs for lying?

# Procedure
## Steps
Player 1 is told to send a message to player 2 about the payoff.
Player 2 then decides which payoff option to choose based without any additional info about the payoff.

## Roles 
This is a 2-player game where player 1 sends a message to player 2 chooses option A or B. Player 1 can choose to tell the truth or lie to player 2 and player 2 can choose to heed or ignore the advice of player 1. 

## Instructions
From the Appendix:
Instructions for player 1
This is a short experiment in decision making. In this experiment, you will be matched with another student from a different class. Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other. The money that you earn will be paid to you next week, privately and in cash.

Two possible monetary payments are available to you and your counterpart in the experiment. The two payment options are:

Option A: $5 to you and $6 to the other student

Option B: $6 to you and $5 to the other student

The choice rests with the other student who will have to choose either option A or option B. The only information your counterpart will have is information sent by you in a message. That is, he or she will not know the monetary payments associated with each choice.

We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible messages, which you will send to your counterpart:

Message 1: "Option A will earn you more money than option B."

Message 2: "Option B will earn you more money than option A."

We will show the other student your message, and ask him or her to choose either A or B. To repeat, your counterpart's choice will determine the payments in the experiment. However, your counterpart will never know what sums were actually offered in the option not chosen (that is, he or she will never know whether your message was true or not). Moreover, he or she will never know the sums to be paid to you according to the different options.

We will pay the two of you according to the choice made by your counterpart.

I choose to send (please circle one option):

Message 1 Message 2

Instructions for player 2
Two possible monetary payments are available to you and your counterpart in the experiment. The payments depend on the option chosen by you. We showed the two payment options to your counterpart. The only information you will have is the message your counterpart sends to you.

Two possible messages could be sent:

Message 1: "Option A will earn you more money than option B."

Message 2: "Option B will earn you more money than option A."

Your counterpart decided to send you message: ___

We now ask you to choose either option A or option B. Your choice will determine the payments in the experiment. You will never know what sums were actually offered in the option not chosen (that is, if the message sent by your counterpart was true or not). Moreover, you will never know the sums your counterpart could be paid with the other option.

We will pay the two of you according to the choice you make.

I choose (please circle one):

Option A Option B


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
While there are no formal performance calculations, participants can earn a higher payoff by lying to the other person.

## Incentives
Participants are paid cash. Either $5 or $6 depending on the action chosen.
