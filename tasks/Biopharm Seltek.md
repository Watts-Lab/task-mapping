## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
1. Study 1A: Participants were first made to participate in randomly assigned research projects. They were then presented with two questions aimed at understanding whether phantom anchors were used as a real negotiation strategy. The questions were aimed at asking what percentage of negotiations did they first ask for their planned price and then offer a price they were willing to settle for, thereby showing the presence of a phantom anchor. 
2. Study 2: All participants were told to imagine that they were selling their car, which was presented as a well-maintained model with low mileage that was likely to sell for $9500–$13,500. They were informed that they had placed advertisements online, had been contacted by several buyers, and were now meeting one of the buyers face-to-face to negotiate the price.
3. Study 3: Participants were randomly assigned to the role of buyer or seller in a short car sale negotiation. They were also randomly assigned to their negotiation dyad. They received and had 15 minutes to read their materials in preparation for the negotiation. Participants in the buyer role received instructions informing them that they needed to buy a new car and had two prospects, both of which were the same make and model. The first car was in good condition, but its seller refused to budge from €10,000. The second car was also in good condition but slightly older. Buyers were told that the market price for the second car was €8000-€9000. Finally, they learned that they were about to meet the seller of this second car to negotiate the price.
4. Study 4: Participants received their role materials, which randomly assigned them to the role of a restaurant space owner or a representative of a restaurant chain. The exercise was loosely based on the Dispute Resolution Research Center’s More Growth for Tonto (www.negotiationexercises.com) and involved the rental of a restaurant space. The scenario included one distributive issue, price per square foot, and two trade-off issues, date of first rent payment and duration of the lease. All issues were quantified with points, thus clarifying the extent to which participants valued the issues. The structure of the negotiation was such that the rental space owner valued the date of the first rent payment more than the duration of the lease, whereas the restaurant chain representative held the reverse preference ordering. This structure meant that if the negotiators were able to uncover these priorities, they could make efficient trade-offs and reach a pareto efficient outcome. The distributive issue afforded both sides the most points and was thus the most important issue. 



# Procedure
## Steps
1. Two coders (two master’s students, both blind to the study hypotheses) read both sides of the negotiation case. We then trained them to identify offers containing phantom anchors, defined as, “An offer containing a ‘would-be’ or aspirational figure in negotiation.” Additionally, we explained that an offer with a phantom anchor “contains two numerical offers, e.g., ‘I was planning on asking for $12 K for the car but I am okay with $10 K,’” providing several examples. We also asked the coders to identify whether the phantom anchor was contained in a first or subsequent offer as well as whether the buyer or seller made the offer.
2. Each coder read and coded the same 20 transcripts independently, noting the number of offers containing phantom anchors in each transcript and recording the information above. 
3. Following a meeting to discuss ambiguous cases and resolve disagreements, the coders then independently coded the remaining 62 transcripts (initial κ=0.83). 
4. Finally, they met to resolve any remaining disagreements. 
5. Ultimately, the coders reached agreement on the statements constituting phantom anchors in each transcript. 

## Details of Negotiation Case
Individuals negotiated in the lab, and their negotiation sessions were recorded and transcribed. In that study, one hundred and sixty-four participants (82 dyads) from a research participant pool maintained by a Mid-Atlantic U.S. university conducted a distributive negotiation over the sale of a biotechnology plants. The participants were members of the public in the city where the study was conducted and did not have any formal training on negotiation, nor instruction in phantom anchors. They ranged from 18 to 57 years in age, and 58% were women.

## Instructions

**Synertech-Dosagen**

Confidential Information for Synertech

You are the CFO of Synertech, a global pharmaceutical company with annual sales of $700 million, and significant cash reserves.  You need a new plant to manufacture a line of genetically-engineered compounds that are in the advanced stage of development.  You cannot modify one of your existing plants, because of the peculiarities of manufacturing genetically-engineered compounds.

The total cost for building a new plant is $25 million.  If everything were to go perfectly, you estimate it would be a year before the plant was fully operational complete with FDA approval.  The product manager says that the market is ready for the compounds.  Production will be ready to begin in three months.  

Dosagen, a pharmaceutical company with sales of $150 million, has for sale a plant that is suitable for manufacturing genetically-engineered compounds.  Dosagen’s plant is up and running and already has FDA approval.

You are about to meet with the CFO of Dosagen.  You have full authority to buy the plant at whatever price you deem acceptable.  No other terms can be added to the negotiation.

Your instructions for the negotiation also include making sure to let the CFO of Dosagen make the first offer in the negotiation. This will give you a sense of how much they may be willing to accept for their plant. Once they make the first offer, you should make sure to provide them a counteroffer.

**General Information**

Dosagen purchased this plant from Biotech, a diversified chemical company, three years ago for $15 million.  Biotech was at the time in bankruptcy and needed cash badly, so this purchase price may not be a good indicator of market value at that time.

Two years ago, the Dosagen plant was appraised at $19 million.  The local real estate market has declined 5% since then.  However, the Dosagen plant is a unique property and general real estate trends may not apply.

A plant similar to the Dosagen plant, although newer, sold for $26 million nine months ago.
