## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
1. Study two: all participants were told to imagine that they were selling their car, which was presented as a well-maintained model with low mileage that was likely to sell for $9500–$13,500. They were informed that they had placed advertisements online, had been contacted by several buyers, and were now meeting one of the buyers face-to-face to negotiate the price.
2. Study Three: Participants were randomly assigned to the role of buyer or seller in a short car sale negotiation. They were also randomly assigned to their negotiation dyad. They received and had 15 minutes to read their materials in preparation for the negotiation. Participants in the buyer role received instructions informing them that they needed to buy a new car and had two prospects, both of which were the same make and model. The first car was in good condition, but its seller refused to budge from €10,000. The second car was also in good condition but slightly older. Buyers were told that the market price for the second car was €8000-€9000. Finally, they learned that they were about to meet the seller of this second car to negotiate the price.
3. Study Four: Participants received their role materials, which randomly assigned them to the role of a restaurant space owner or a representative of a restaurant chain. The exercise was loosely based on the Dispute Resolution Research Center’s More Growth for Tonto (www.negotiationexercises.com) and involved the rental of a restaurant space. The scenario included one distributive issue, price per square foot, and two trade-off issues, date of first rent payment and duration of the lease. All issues were quantified with points, thus clarifying the extent to which participants valued the issues. The structure of the negotiation was such that the rental space owner valued the date of the first rent payment more than the duration of the lease, whereas the restaurant chain representative held the reverse preference ordering. This structure meant that if the negotiators were able to uncover these priorities, they could make efficient trade-offs and reach a pareto efficient outcome. The distributive issue afforded both sides the most points and was thus the most important issue. 



# Procedure
## Steps
1. two coders (two master’s students, both blind to the study hypotheses) read both sides of the negotiation case. We then trained them to identify offers containing phantom anchors, defined as, “An offer containing a ‘would-be’ or aspirational figure in negotiation.” Additionally, we explained that an offer with a phantom anchor “contains two numerical offers, e.g., ‘I was planning on asking for $12 K for the car but I am okay with $10 K,’” providing several examples. We also asked the coders to identify whether the phantom anchor was contained in a first or subsequent offer as well as whether the buyer or seller made the offer.
2. Each coder read and coded the same 20 transcripts independently, noting the number of offers containing phantom anchors in each transcript and recording the information above. 
3. Following a meeting to discuss ambiguous cases and resolve disagreements, the coders then independently coded the remaining 62 transcripts (initial κ=0.83). 
4. Finally, they met to resolve any remaining disagreements. 
5. Ultimately, the coders reached agreement on the statements constituting phantom anchors in each transcript.
