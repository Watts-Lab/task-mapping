# Summary
This task is the NASA moon survival test. This requires subjects to imagine themselves crash landed on the moon 200 miles from base. All but 15 pieces of equipment have been destroyed. The surviving items are to be ranked in order of their declining contribution to survival on the long trek to safety.

# Procedure
## Steps
Interacting groups:
> Subjects first solved the NASA moon problem as individuals
> 
> There were then randomly allocated to groups and developed a team solution
> 
> Ten minutes were allowed for the first phase and 30 for the second

Simulation groups:
> Groups were constructed with a computer routine
> 
> Individuals were drawn at random to form groups of 1 to 7 members
> 
> The computer program developed group solutions by calculating the weighted sums of individual ranks for each item in the exercise, and then subsequently ranking these sums. The error score was then calculated in the usual way: that is, as the sum of absolute deviations from the NASA expert solution.


Three simulations were run
> > 1. Groups were formed with members drawn at random from the total distribution of NASA scores. 200 teams were sampled for each size level
> > 2. Groups were formed within two ability strata; above median ability and below median ability. 200 teams were sampled for each size and ability level.
> > 3. Groups were formed within six specific ability bands. In terms of NASA scores, the strata were 6-16, 18-28, 30-40, 42-52, 54-64, 66-76. Fifty groups were simulated for each size and ability level.

Groups were assigned to unit and nonunit weight categories. First, using the member solutions, artificial w= 0 and w = 2 group solutions were generated. Second, deviation scores, that is, the sums of absolute differences between actual and artificial groups were computed. Groups which deviated less from the to w= 0 strategy than the w = 2 strategy were assigned to the unit weight category, and vice versa.

## Roles 
The participants were mangers and graduate management students, and were to participate individually and in the group setting they were assigned.


## Instructions
Adapted by the CSS Lab

This task is an exercise in group and/or individual problem solving. Imagine yourself crash landed on the moon 200 miles from base. All but 15 pieces of equipment have been destroyed. The surviving items are to be ranked in order of their declining contribution to survival on the long trek to safety. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance is a simple inverse function of the unit weighted sum of the absolute differences between the ranks assigned and the correct ranks as determined by the Crew Equipment Research Unit at NASA

## Incentives
It was one of a sequence of activities comprising courses in management development for the managers, and managerial psychology for the students.
