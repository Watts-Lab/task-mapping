# Summary
This task is the NASA moon survival test. This requires subjects to imagine themselves crash landed on the moon 200 miles from base. All but 15 pieces of equipment have been destroyed. The surviving items are to be ranked in order of their declining contribution to survival on the long trek to safety.

# Procedure
## Steps
Interacting groups:
> Subjects first solved the NASA moon problem as individuals
> There were then randomly allocated to groups and developed a team solution
> Ten minutes were allowed for the first phase and 30 for the second

Simulation groups:
> Groups were constructed with a computer routine
> Individuals were drawn at random to form groups of 1 to 7 members
> Three simulations were run
> > 1. Groups were formed with members drawn at random from the total distribution of NASA scores. 200 teams were sampled for each size level
> > 2. Groups were formed within two ability strate; above median ability and below median ability. 200 teams were sampled for each size and ability level.
> > 3. Groups were formed within size specific ability bands. Fifty groups were simulated for each size and ability level.

## Roles 
The participants were mangers and graduate management students, and were to participate individually and in the group setting they were assigned.


## Instructions
Adapted by the CSS Lab

This task is an exercise in group and/or individual problem solving. Imagine yourself crash landed on the moon 200 miles from base. All but 15 pieces of equipment have been destroyed. The surviving items are to be ranked in order of their declining contribution to survival on the long trek to safety. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance is a simple inverse function of the unit weighted sum of the absolute differences between the ranks assigned and the correct ranks as determined by the Crew Equipment Research Unit at NASA

## Incentives
It was one of a sequence of activities comprising courses in management development for the managers, and managerial psychology for the students.
