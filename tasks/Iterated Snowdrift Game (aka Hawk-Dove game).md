# Summary
Prisoner’s Dilemma: two players have the opportunity to either cooperate or defect, with cooperation resulting in a benefit to the opposing player but entailing a cost to the cooperation

Snowdrift Game: two drivers (players) are trapped on either side of a snowdrift and have the options of staying in the car or removing the snowdrift. Letting the opponent do all the work is the best option but if the other player stays in the car it is better to shovel

# Stimuli
## The visual components
For each interaction, the players indicated whether they cooperated (C) or defected (D) by holding up a card with the letter ‘C’ or ‘D’

Participants were given 800 units of Monopoly (Parker Brothers) money

Participants were shown the following payoff matrix with written instructions- see image folder 

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Students are assigned to groups of six individuals and randomly arranged in pairs 
2. Half of groups play iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) and the other half play iterated snow drift game (ISD) then alternating 
3. Each game ends after 12 interactions 
4. At the end of the game, the players had to fill in a questionnaire stating their sex and whether they had previously heard about game theory

## Roles 
There were three game instructors: two who coordinated the game (coordinators) and one who immediately recorded all players' moves and the resulting pay-offs after each interaction (administrator).

## Instructions
Instructions: Hawk Dove Game 
You are now taking part in an economic game experiment which has been financed by various foundations for research promotion. Please read the following directions carefully, and you can earn a considerable amount of money according your final score. It is worthy mentioning that all 20 participants here have received the same direction document. You should select the strategy depending on your own
decisions. It is forbidden to communicate with the other participants during the experiment. If you violate this rule, we shall have to exclude you from the experiment and from all payments. There are 20 subjects participating in the economic game experiment, and will be allocated anonymously to four groups of five subjects. Therefore, you will have four group members when the experiment stated, and play games with all your four group members. In the game experiment, each subject has two strategies to choose: cooperation or defect. The names of strategies does not have any morals meaning, and you should choose the strategy the maximize your profit score, because the more score you have the more money you earn in the end of the game. After you choose the strategy in a round, your profit score is sum of all payoff from games played with your four group members according to payoff matrix described in the second paragraph. It is worthy mentioning that after a round you can choose the strategy afresh according to your own decision, and profit score are affected by both your decision and choices of your group members. The total profit score you obtained in the end is the sum of all the profit score of all rounds. One score unit corresponds to 1.0 RMB in our experiment, so you will earn the money which is equal to your final score multiplied by 1.0 RMB when the experiment finished. The payoff matrix of the game carried out here is describe below. Supposing you play the game with a subject labeled A, there are four possible different conditions you may meet, accordingly you obtain different payoffs:

(1) If you cooperate and A defects, then your payoff is 0.9, As payoff is 1.1.
(2) If you cooperate and A also cooperates, then both you and A obtain payoff of 1.0.
(3) If you defect and A cooperates, then your payoff is 1.1, As payoff is 0.9.
(4) If you defect and A also defects, then both you and A obtain payoff of 0.0.
Since you play games with your four group members, your profit score in this round is sum of all payoff from games played with your four group members according to payoff matrix described above.
Supposing you, subject A, subject B, subject C, and subject D in the same group, here some questions you need to answer correct to start experiment:
Q1: If you chose cooperation, subject A and subject B also chose cooperation, subject C and subject D chose defection, then you obtain your profit score in this round__________?
Q2: If you chose defection, subject A and subject B also chose cooperation, subject C and subject D chose defection, and then you obtain your profit score in this round__________?
Q3: If your total profit score at the end of the game is 50.0, how much we should pay cash to you__________RMB?


Prisoner's Dilemna Instructions
B, and B2 are the only owners of sources of mineral water in the country. There are no imports of mineral water. The price of mineral water is the same for both suppliers. The larger the aggregate supply is, the lower the price.

![Decision table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78745728/136622917-ed4cafa8-5444-4eeb-be1b-5c9e42f1e946.png)

There are two sizes of bottle filling machines. A signifies the large machine, a signifies the small machine. If both suppliers order the small machine then a small quantity will be supplied and the market price of mineral water will be high. Both producers will have a profit of 50. If both order the large machine then a larger quantity will be produced and the market price will be lower. Both producers will have a profit of 10. If B, orders the large machine and B, the small one, then B, will have a profit of 75 and B, a profit of 0, and vice versa. The results of decisions of the suppliers are indicated in table A.l. In every box, you find the profit of B, in the upper left corner and the profit to B, in the lower right corner. Additional instructions for the PD-players Number: Both producers decide at the same time, i.e. without knowing the decision of the other producer. How would you decide in the place of B, or B;! Reply: I choose.. Every number is given to two of the persons present. After all decisions have been made, a number is selected by chance. The two persons with this number are rewarded according to their decisions and the resulting profits. Profits are paid in DM. 

Additional instructions for players 1 in SPD Number: 

First B, decides, then B, decides. You are B,! How do you decide? Reply: I choose.. . Every number is given to two of the persons present. After all decisions have been made, a number is selected by chance. The two persons with this number are rewarded according to their decisions and the resulting profits. Profits are paid in DM. 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Previous knowledge about game theory and the date of experiments to determine the effect on cooperation and found that they did not 

The proportion of cooperative acts among player pairs between the two games (IPD or ISD) and between different sex combinations within player pairs (two females, two males or a male and a female). 

Mean proportion of cooperative acts in the IPD and the ISD differs from the expected values for one-shot interactions, which are 0 for the PD and 0.5 for the SD. 

Calculated the proportion of cooperative acts for each interaction separately and tested whether there is a significant correlation in the proportion of cooperative acts with increasing number of interactions.
 

## Incentives
The participants could keep what they won in each game. They were further instructed that players with the four highest pay-offs among all players of the same game would receive 40 Swiss francs (CHF), 30 CHF, 20 CHF or 10 CHF, respectively.
