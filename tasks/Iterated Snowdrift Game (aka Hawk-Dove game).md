# Summary
Prisoner’s Dilemma: two players have the opportunity to either cooperate or defect, with cooperation resulting in a benefit to the opposing player but entailing a cost to the cooperation

Snowdrift Game: two drivers (players) are trapped on either side of a snowdrift and have the options of staying in the car or removing the snowdrift. Letting the opponent do all the work is the best option but if the other player stays in the car it is better to shovel

# Stimuli
## The visual components
For each interaction, the players indicated whether they cooperated (C) or defected (D) by holding up a card with the letter ‘C’ or ‘D’

Participants were given 800 units of Monopoly (Parker Brothers) money

Participants were shown the following payoff matrix with written instructions- see image folder 

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Students are assigned to groups of six individuals and randomly arranged in pairs 
2. Half of groups play iterated prisoner’s dilemma (IPD) and the other half play iterated snow drift game (ISD) then alternating 
3. Each game ends after 12 interactions 
4. At the end of the game, the players had to fill in a questionnaire stating their sex and whether they had previously heard about game theory

## Roles 
There were three game instructors: two who coordinated the game (coordinators) and one who immediately recorded all players' moves and the resulting pay-offs after each interaction (administrator).

## Instructions
None online- need to reach out to instructors 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Previous knowledge about game theory and the date of experiments to determine the effect on cooperation and found that they did not 

The proportion of cooperative acts among player pairs between the two games (IPD or ISD) and between different sex combinations within player pairs (two females, two males or a male and a female). 

Mean proportion of cooperative acts in the IPD and the ISD differs from the expected values for one-shot interactions, which are 0 for the PD and 0.5 for the SD. 

Calculated the proportion of cooperative acts for each interaction separately and tested whether there is a significant correlation in the proportion of cooperative acts with increasing number of interactions.
 

## Incentives
The participants could keep what they won in each game. They were further instructed that players with the four highest pay-offs among all players of the same game would receive 40 Swiss francs (CHF), 30 CHF, 20 CHF or 10 CHF, respectively.
