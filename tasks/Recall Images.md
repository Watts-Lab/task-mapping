# Summary
This task focused on short-term memory, which is closely associated with fluid intelligence / IQ. The task tests participants’ ability to memorize three
different types of stimuli: words, images and stories.

Stimuli used in individual tests are based on these images: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78745728/116819043-4b05f080-ab3c-11eb-9bd9-f4bdd6a6258b.png)


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants complete phase one of the experiment which includes series of online tests to measure their individual skill at three problem-solving tasks: Memory,
Optimization, and Shapes
2. Participants come to the lab and are randomly assigned to groups of three people. Each group completes a collective version of the individual problem-solving tasks: Memory, Optimization and Shapes. Participants visit the lab twice. During each visit, participants work in two separate groups. Over the course of the experiment, participants are allocated to a total of four groups. The average time between the individual assessment and the first lab visit is 11 days. The average time between the first and second lab visit is 11 days. 
3. Participants start with the inividual tests,participants completed the images test, in which they were given 20 seconds to memorize six target faces (the stimuli come from the Cambridge Face Memory Test. Participants were then presented with 15 sets of three faces and asked to identify target faces. 
4. After completing individual tests, participants get feedback and their overall performance relatative to other participants 
5. Particants then do the group version of the task. Each group of three people work face-to-face in a single room. The tasks are computer based and each participant is provided with a laptop. Group members introduce themselves. Then, groups are required to nominate a ‘Reporter’. The Reporter is responsible for entering their group’s answers. Participants also gather around the Reporter’s laptop for some tasks. Before each problem-solving task, groups were prompted to discuss their strategy. In batteries B and D groups completed practice versions of each task.
6. Each group is given 40 seconds to collectively remember 12 words, 6 images, and 2 stories. We add story and images stimuli to those described above, so that each time a group encountered the Memory task they are asked to memorize unseen material
7. Each member of the group view their own laptop and could view any of the three stimuli. Participants could change the stimuli they were memorizing during the 40 second memorization period. During the 40 second memorization period, participants could change the stimulus they were viewing at any time by using the buttons in the top left of their screens. 
8. Before the memorization period began, groups were prompted to discuss their strategy.
9. After the memorization period, all three team members gathered around the Reporter’s laptop to answer a set of 24 questions about the stimuli. There are an equal number of questions about each type of stimuli. The structure of the questions mirror those used in the individual assessments

## Instructions
See image in stimuli section & reached out to authors 5/2 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Individual performance on memorizing and identifying stimuli based on questions after memorization period
Group performance on memorizing and identifying stimuli based on questions after memorization period

## Incentives
Participants who completed the study were paid a total of $100: $10 for completing the individual tests; $30 for lab visit 1;and $60 for lab visit 2. We elected not to explicitly pay groups for better performance, relying instead on intrinsic motivation through priming.
