# Summary
This task involved three successive recalls of hidden animals in puzzle pictures in which the initial and final recalls were individual, and the second was performed either in collaborating pairs or as individuals. This study is designed to show the prediction that inhibition resulting from collaboration should be temporary, and that items inhibited in collaborative recall should tend to reappear in subsequent individual recall in the absence of disruption from a partner.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Ten puzzle pictures from the Ultimate Noahs Ark by Mike Wilks were used as stimulus materials. Each picture contained approximately 40 hidden animals, 4 of which were selected at random to act as target stimuli.

# Procedure
## Steps
Participants were told that the study was concerned with processes involved in social interaction. They either worked alone or in pairs.

They were presented with a sequence of 10 puzzle pictures containing hidden animals. Each picture was shown for 30s together with the names of four target animals that participants were asked to find by pointing
 The order of presenting pictures was the same in all conditions

After, each person worked alone for 5 minutes to solve a word search task as a distractor task

Then, the participants were asked for written free recall of the targets. They were given 3 minutes, and did this alone in separate rooms. 

Next, they were given another distractor task for 2 minutes that involved letter cancellation

They then had a second recall for 3 minutes. Pairs were encouraged to collaborate. No instructions were given about how to resolve disagreements. One member of each pair acted as a scribe.

Next, they were given a third distractor task for 3 minutes where they had to produce as many four letter words as possible from a given set of nine letters.

Finally, all participants were given 3 minutes to do a final recall as individuals.

At the end, all participants were debriefed

## Roles 
In the pairs condition, one member of each pair acted as a scribe.

## Instructions
Will ask

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The numbers of correct items on each trial were obtained for all recall protocols. 
To compare pairs with individuals, nominal pairs were formed from random combinations of participants who recalled alone. 
Recall scores were obtained by combining the individual recall protocols and allowing for any redundant items that appeared in both.

Changes in performance between successive recalls were analyzed by examining numbers of new and missing items and measures of subjective organization

Subjective organization was examined using Tulving's measure of bidirectional paired frequency and the Ash-Ebenholz index of relative correct order.


## Incentives
All participants were paid volunteers
