# Summary
This study looks at the effects of time limits and different task types on the quality and quantity of group performance and patterns of group interaction. 

Specifically how time limits effect of ten and twenty minutes impact story generation (production), developing a plan of action (planning) or a summary of the discussion of an issue (discussion). The results are interpreted in terms of social entrainment, meaning how people modify and adjust behavior based on changes to condition.

# Stimuli
## The visual components

There were no visual components to the study 

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 

There were no alternative versions of these specific experiments however they did take place a part of a larger study 

# Procedure
## Steps
Step One: Participants told they were in study on task types and told time limits on the task performance group. They were told an observer would be in the room to make periodic observations 

Step Two: The experimenter read the first problem to the group, give a time limit for the first session and instruct participants to use the full time available. This instruction was intended to counteract the participants desire to finish the experiment as quickly as possible

Step Three: Once the first trial is complete, experimenters collected the solutions and pass out a questionnaire 

Step Four: Experimenter would read second problem when all participants had finished the questionnaire and would begin timing the session/making observations  

Step Five: Once the second trial was complete, experimenters collected the solutions and pass out a questionnaire

Step Six: once the questionnaires were completed the participants were debriefed and excused 

## Roles 

No roles were assigned to participants however participants were assigned to four person same-sex groups for the tasks 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The quality of the written reports were assessed on four dimensions developed by Hackman, Jones and McGrath (1967) (https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1967-10399-001): 

The dimensions are: length, originality, quality of presentation, adequacy and creativity and one dimension assessing the length (Quantity)

All group products were rated on scales assessing five dimensions using a 7- pile sort-resort procedure by three judges- two assessed each dimension and all three 

assessed product rating, scores for dimensions were averaged in analysis  

Observations of group behavior were also recorded- an observer recorded a code for each comment at the ten second mark of ten second intervals 

Observers underwent a month of training based on an interrater reliability criterion of 0.9
