# Summary
Sudoku is a popular logical reasoning game where a 9x9 grid (subdivided into nine 3x3 boxes) is partially filled with numbers from 1 to 9. Each number can only appear once per column, once per row, and once in each 3x3 box. A proper Sudoku grid has one unique solution and one correct number for each grid space. Groups were asked to collectively solve Sudoku puzzles in two conditions, face-to-face and online.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. All participants were seated in front of personal laptop computers and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the tasks, ensuring that all members of a group worked on the same tasks at the same time.
2. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: face-to-face or online. 
 
 Each face-to-face group was seated in a private room around a small table and was allowed to communicate freely. 
 
 Members in the online groups were randomly seated in a large room with members of other groups. They did not know who else was in their group, and they only communicated with their group members via text chat in the shared online system

3. The sudoku task had a fixed duration of five minutes, after which the next task would automatically begin.
4. Partipants were instructed to fill in the sudoku puzzle on their screens, screens synchronized so each move was seen by all group members

# Instructions
As a group, please fill in this sudoku puzzle so that every row, every column, and every 3/3 box has the digits 1-9 once and only once. 

The puzzle spaces are synchronized so your group will see what you type as soon as you click out of a space. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
1. Amount of verbal communication in face-to-face groups
2. Amount of text chat communication in online groups
3. Collective intelligence on all groups scores on all tasks: weighted averages of the different task scores, with the weights derived from the correlations between the tasks and the first factor. 
4. Puzzles Solved 


## Incentives
All participants were paid for their participation (amount unkown).
