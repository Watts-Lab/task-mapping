# Procedure
## Steps
### Pre-survey
> 1. Individuals completed the Wonderlic Personnel Test (WPT), a 50-item measure that is widely used for assessing individual intelligence.
> 2. Individuals completed the the NEO Five Factor Inventory. 
> 3. Individuals completed a RME (Readoing the Mind in Eyes) test
### Task
> Participants were randomly assigned to work by themselves or in a team of 2, 3, 4, or 5 members
> 
> Groups were given a hard copy of a picture created by coloring cells in a spreadsheet, and had to duplicate the picture as accurately as possible using a
shared online spreadsheet tool. Groups had 5 minutes to explore the tool, followed by one simple
five-minute training task, and then were given 10 minutes to complete the trial task. Groups were
given 1 point for each cell colored correctly.
### Post-survey
> 4. Group satisfaction was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as “I have been
very satisfied working on this team” on a five-point scale.
> 5. Motivation was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as “I would feel bad and
unhappy if our team has performed poorly” (reverse-scored) on a five-point scale.
> 6. Social cohesiveness was measured: Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as “Members of this group would
enjoy being at a party together” on a five-point scale. 
> 7. Psychological safety was measured; Participants indicated their agreement to statements such as “It is difficult to
ask other members of this team for help” on a five-point scale.

## Roles 
> Groups of 1-5 members all shared the same role

## Instructions
> 1. Participants were instructed to individually complete personality tests
> 2. Participants were given 5 minutes to explore the online spreadsheet tool, 5 minutes to complete the training task, and 10 minutes to complete the trial task with their group
> 3. Participants were instructed to complete the post-survey scales
> 
# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Groups were scored by how many cells they colored correctly in the 10 minute period

## Incentives
> Groups were given 1 point for each cell colored correctly
