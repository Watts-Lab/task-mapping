# Summary
Space Fortress is a video game in which participants control a space ship, and must manage resources, launch attacks, and avoid taking damage.

# Procedure
## Steps
Screening of Participants:
- Participants are subjected to an aiming drill, as described in Donchin and Mané(1989).  The aiming drill is a simplified version of the Space Fortress game.  During the drill, the ship is located in the center of the screen, and has to rotate to shoot at mines that appear one at a time in 24 locations around the screen.  Mines do not move and will disappear if not struck by a missile within 10 seconds.
- Participants are scored on how quickly and accurately they destroy the mines, and are either kept on for the experiment or dismissed based on their best score of three, two minute aiming drills.
Training and Testing:
- Participants are scheduled to participate in 10 one hour training sessions, spread over two consecutive weeks(five days a week, for two weeks).
- During practice periods participants were subjected to different training protocols (based on the description of the experiment being ran, for example in Arthur et al(1995) there were five different training protocols, LIST THEM HERE).
- Once the training period was over there is a testing phase, where participants completed two, three-minute test games and two, three-minute rest periods.  All test games were played individually, regardless of training protocol followed.

## Roles 
Participants work either in teams or alone, to train and then compete in the Space Fortress game.

## Instructions
(Waiting on a response from experimenters)

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The score of the game is how performance is evaluated.  Scoring varries between experiments.  Generally speaking, participants score points for damaging the fortress, destroying enemy mines, energizing friendly mines, selecting point bonuses when available, and destroying the fortress.  Participants will lose points for firing missiles after their supply is depleted, taking damage from a mine or fortress, and destroying their ship.

General Scoring as defined by Mané and Donchin(1989):

Additionally, Edwards et. al. introduced additional scoring metrics.  They offered addition points for controlling the ship well.  Control points were awarded when the ship was between certain bounds, and points were lost if the ship was piloted off the screen, or entering a boundary around the fortress.  Additionally points were added to the score if the ships velocity was kept below a critical velocity.  The last additional criteria introduced in this experiment was speed at which participants interacted with mines.

## Incentives
In most scenarios participants are paid based on their attendance, and ability to participate in the task.  Since most studies occur over a period of a few days or weeks, and require participants to return for multiple practice sessions, participants are paid for what they complete.  
In the case of Arthur et al. (1995) participants were paid $45 to participate in 10 one-hour sessions, held on weeks days, for two consecutive weeks.  Participants were paid $2.50 for each day they were present, and were terminated if they or their partner missed the session and could not reschedule during the same day.  
Some bonus incentives were offered as well.  In the case of Arthur et al(1995), once participants finished all 10 sessions they were entered into a lottery to win an additional $50.  Bonuses were also offered based on the participants average score in the game during the 10th session.  The bonuses were $100 for first (highest score), $60 for second, and $40 for third.  Participants were informed of the extra incentives, but were not told how the other participants performed until after the experiment concluded.
For reference, Edwards et al(2006) followed a similar incentive system, participants were paid $75 for their participation over 10 training days, and offered $50, $30, and $20 bonuses for the teams with the top three scores.
