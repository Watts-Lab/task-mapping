# Procedure
## Steps
Screening of Participants:
- Participants are subjected to an aiming drill, as described in Donchin and Mané(1989).  The aiming drill is a simplified version of the Space Fortress game.  During the drill, the ship is located in the center of the screen, and has to rotate to shoot at mines that appear one at a time in 24 locations around the screen.  Mines do not move and will disappear if not struck by a missile within 10 seconds.
- Participants are scored on how quickly and accurately they destroy the mines, and are either kept on for the experiment or dismissed based on their best score of three, two minute aiming drills.
Training and Testing:
- Participants are scheduled to participate in 10 one hour training sessions, spread over two consecutive weeks(five days a week, for two weeks).
- During practice periods participants were subjected to different training protocols.
  - Based on the description of the experiment being ran, for example in Arthur et al(1995) there were five different training protocols.  
        - Individual: one participant controls everything.  
        - AIM-Dyad: one participant controls the joystick(pilot/gunner) while the other controls response tasks(mine/missile manager).  
        - Dyad-Player: paired with a Dyad-Observer, the Dyad-Player controlled the joystick, but not the response tasks, this allowed them to better focus on their tasks.  
        - Dyad-Observer: simply watched the Dyad-Player, did not communicate with their partner, just watched and learned from their partners mistakes.  
        - Test-Only Dyad: These subjects were given a partner, but did not train on the space fortress game, rather they trained on a hand held game (Road Race by Tiger Electronics Inc., 1991).  
- Once the training period was over there is a testing phase, where participants completed two, three-minute test games and two, three-minute rest periods.  All test games were played individually, regardless of training protocol followed.

## Roles 
Participants work either in teams or alone, to train and then compete in the Space Fortress game.

Base game description interpreted from Mané, Amir, and Emanuel Donchin(1989):  
The objective of the game is to launch missiles from your spaceship and destroy a space fortress.  In addition to this objective, the subject wants to avoid damaging the ship. The user faces a screen during play, and wears headphones that present sound effects for firing missiles and explosions.   
The subject controls the ship using a joystick and a trigger.  The ship moves in a frictionless environment and thus will continue to move after input is no longer given.  To change direction the subject will move the joystick left or right which causes the ship to rotate.  Moving the joystick forward or backward causes the ship to accelerate. When the ship reaches the edge of the screen it enters “hyper-space” and immediately reappears on the other side of the screen.  
To damage the fortress, the subject must first make it vulnerable by hitting it with 10 missiles fired with at least 250msec between shots.  Once it is vulnerable it can be destroyed with a burst of two missiles fired with less than 250msec between them.  The number of hits scored on the fortress is always displayed next to the fortress.  
The fortress will track the subjects movement and will always face the ship.  The fortress will fire it’s own projectiles (called shells) at the ship, and will create mines which will chase the ship, and will cause damage unless action is taken against them.  There are two types of minds, friendly and enemy.  They are labeled with a letter to identify the type, this letters meaning is given to the participant before the game begins.  Enemy mines must be destroyed with a missile.  Friendly mines need to be energized.  The user must switch weapon systems by double tapping a button.  Once the weapon system is switch they can launch a missile at the mine, and it will be energized, after it is energized it will score a hit on the fortress.  If the subject fails to energize a friendly mine or destroy and enemy mine it will disappear after 10 seconds.  While mines are on the screen, the user cannot score hits on the fortress.  
If a mine or fortress shell hits the ship it does damage.  If the ship is hit four times it is destroyed, this reset the game.  
The subject is given 100 missiles at the start of the game, the number of remaining missiles is always displayed on the screen.  Once the supply is depleted, the subject can continue firing missiles at a cost of points every time a missile fired.  Opportunity to receive extra missiles is provided periodically.  This is done by prompting the user using a sequence of symbols appearing underneath the fortress.  Every time a sequence of two dollar signs appears under the fortress, the user can receive extra missiles or extra points by pressing one of two buttons while the second dollar sign in the sequence is present on the screen.
Score is computed and displayed throughout the game.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The score of the game is how performance is evaluated.  Scoring varries between experiments.  Generally speaking, participants score points for damaging the fortress, destroying enemy mines, energizing friendly mines, selecting point bonuses when available, and destroying the fortress.  Participants will lose points for firing missiles after their supply is depleted, taking damage from a mine or fortress, and destroying their ship.

General Scoring as defined by Mané and Donchin(1989):

Additionally, Edwards et. al. introduced additional scoring metrics.  They offered addition points for controlling the ship well.  Control points were awarded when the ship was between certain bounds, and points were lost if the ship was piloted off the screen, or entering a boundary around the fortress.  Additionally points were added to the score if the ships velocity was kept below a critical velocity.  The last additional criteria introduced in this experiment was speed at which participants interacted with mines.

## Incentives
In most scenarios participants are paid based on their attendance, and ability to participate in the task.  Since most studies occur over a period of a few days or weeks, and require participants to return for multiple practice sessions, participants are paid for what they complete.  
In the case of Arthur et al. (1995) participants were paid $45 to participate in 10 one-hour sessions, held on weeks days, for two consecutive weeks.  Participants were paid $2.50 for each day they were present, and were terminated if they or their partner missed the session and could not reschedule during the same day.  
Some bonus incentives were offered as well.  In the case of Arthur et al(1995), once participants finished all 10 sessions they were entered into a lottery to win an additional $50.  Bonuses were also offered based on the participants average score in the game during the 10th session.  The bonuses were $100 for first (highest score), $60 for second, and $40 for third.  Participants were informed of the extra incentives, but were not told how the other participants performed until after the experiment concluded.
For reference, Edwards et al(2006) followed a similar incentive system, participants were paid $75 for their participation over 10 training days, and offered $50, $30, and $20 bonuses for the teams with the top three scores.
