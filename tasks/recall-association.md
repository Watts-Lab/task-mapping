# Summary

This study was designed to understand collaborative inhibition causes. Researchers compare individual recall (control) to two collaborative group conditions, 
one in which people took turns recalling items together (See Group), the other in which people take turns recalling items but are not aware of the items their partner 
has recalled (No See Group). Findings how that collaborative inhibition is due to interference caused by the product of recall- sharing answers with each other,
not the process of taking turns without sharing.

# Stimuli

No Visuals Included in paper or appendix but booklet with words printed in black 20 point font was used. Four lists of words from Stadler, Roediger and McDermottâ€™s (1999) corpus of semantic associates were used: bread, man, music and sleep

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 

N/A

# Procedure
## Steps

Step One: Assign participants to one of three conditions 

Step Two: Show participants booklet with list of words and give them time to study words 

Step Three: Particpants complete addition tasks to reduce reency effects 

Step Four: Participants enter recall task based on assigned group  

Nominal Condition: participants would work alone to recall words: Tested individually 
Collaborative Group See Condition: participants worked in pairs and took turns recalling words and were showed the words that each other were recalling. They sat opposite each other at a table 

Collaborative Group No See Condition: participants recalled word lists in pairs, using a turn-taking method however they did not  see what word the other recalled

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Performance of each group is determined by number of words recalled correctly on recall sheet 

## Incentives
