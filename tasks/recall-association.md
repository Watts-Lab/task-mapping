# Summary
> This study was designed to understand collaborative inhibition causes. Researchers compare individual recall (control) to two collaborative group conditions, 
one in which people took turns recalling items together (See Group), the other in which people take turns recalling items but are not aware of the items their partner 
has recalled (No See Group). Findings how that collaborative inhibition is due to interference caused by the product of recall- sharing answers with each other,
not the process of taking turns without sharing.

# Stimuli
> No Visuals Included in paper or appendix but booklet with words printed in black 20 point font was used 

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> N/A

# Procedure
## Steps
> Step One: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions with the restriction that there were 20 people in each condition 
        Nominal Condition: participants would work alone to recall words: Tested individually 
        Collaborative Group See Condition: participants worked in pairs and took turns recalling words and were showed the words that 
        each other were recalling. They sat opposite each other at a table
        Collaborative Group No See Condition: participants recalled word lists in pairs, using a turn-taking method however they did not 
        see what word the other recalled
> Step Two: Participants are told they will see a list of words that will be tested on later but not told how they will be tested
> Step Three: Participants are given a booklet containing a word list, they are told to start on page one and study each word (one word in the middle of each page 
in 20 point black font). They are not allowed to talk or write anything down during the study period 
> Step Four: After study period, participants completed addition problems for sixty seconds to reduce recency effects
        
## Roles 
> A description of roles if relevant to the task.  
> If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
> NEED TO REACH OUT TO RESEARCHERS 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Performance of each group is determined by number of words recalled correctly on recall sheet 

## Incentives
> There were no incentives for the project all participants were volunteers
