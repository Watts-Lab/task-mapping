# Summary
The organization games designed to help teachers simulate the complexity of a real world organization.  Participants are all assigned to task units within the organization and must work together to help the group succeed.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Split participants into four equally sized, but physically separated divisions, each having its own “complement of operating units” (line and staff).  The eight basic units are as follows.
    - three production or service delivery units (one unit solves anagrams and the other two work interdependently to solve complex word jumble puzzles)
    - an employee unit
    - a unit for processing and disseminating information
    - an in-house organizational development group
    - an internal accounting unit
    - a slack unit charged with addressing major issues that confronting the organization
2. Participants are given minimal structure and have only unit heads, and resource controllers, from there they must decide how to further develop and staff the organization to create an effective system of operation.  This system must be flexible and able to adapt to internal and external forces.

## Roles 
Participants are assigned a role within the simulation by the instructor.

## Instructions
A complementary copy of the Participant’s and Instructor’s instruction manual could be obtained from the publisher in 1979.

The game operates best with between 18 and 35 players.  With a larger class you may want to create more simulations.

Play is carried out as a series of 50 to 75 minute sessions of operation, for a total of 4-7 sessions.  Each session ends with a 10-15 minute break where the instructor/assistants can tally the score.

Instructors may also introduce environmental changes, or implement organizational development interventions, during or after a session.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Four objective performance indicators are calculated for each session of play after the first session.  The calculations address the organizational effectiveness, and are delivered to the information processing unit at the beginning of each session.  Factors that will impact the score include, productivity of line units, investments in organizational development programs, and events such as members absence, strikes, dismissals, resignations, vacations and underutilization.

Criteria used by Krackhardt and Stern:  
- Resource Base: this is a function for natural decline in resources (-10% of the resource base from last session). 
    - Raw production materials purchased, -1 or -2 per unit depending on what had to be purchased.
    - Member absences, -2 per absence
    - Job quits and firings, -3 per action
    - Vacations, -1 per vacation
    - Unemployment, -1 per person
    - New job assignment, +1 for each
    - Accounting report produced, +2 if produced, -3 if not
    - Investments, +20% of the amount invested
- Total Output: Also a natural decline function, -10% of last sessions total output.
    - New job assignment, -1 for each
    - Vacations, -1 per vacation
    - Unemployment, -1 per person
    - New job assignment, +1 for each
    - Management consulting report produced, +2 if produced, -3 if not
    - Investments, +10% of the amount invested
    - Human resource development programs, +10% of amount invested
    - Production, +3 or +4 depending on type
- Internal Cohesion: Also a function of natural decline, -10% of internal cohesion from last session.
    - Investment in human resource development programs, +20% of amount invested
    - Inter-unit cooperation production, +2 per unit produced
    - Vacations, -1 per vacation
    - Job quits, firings and absences, -3 per each
    - Temporary unemployment, -1 per person, 
    - Permanent unemployment, -3 per person
    - New job assignment, -1 for each
    - Organizational communication report produced, +2 if produced, -3 if not
- Member Commitment: Natural decline function, -10% of member commitment from prior session
    - Investment in human resource development programs, +20% of amount invested
    - Overall production, +2 per unit
    - Job quits, and firings, -3
    - Absences, -2 per each
    - Permanent unemployment, -5 per person,
    - Temporary unemployment, -1 per person 

All of theses adjustments are applied at the end of each session, with the exception of certain investments that require two sessions to take effect.  Players also earn a salary, based on their position and success of the organization and they can decide to reinvest, buy using the salary to purchase materials or invest in programs.

## Incentives
Participants are usually a part of a class and will participate in the game as a part of a learning objective.
