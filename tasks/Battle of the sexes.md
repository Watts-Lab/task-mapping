# Summary
In the Battle of the Sexes game, two players participate in a simple game.  Each player is to make a choice that will impact both them, and the person they are playing with. The objective is to act cooperatively so that both players can reach their optimal solution.

Players are more likely to act cooperatively if they know the other person is making some sacrifice for them, on the other hand if they believe the other player is acting maliciously, they are likely to do the same.

N/A

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are positioned at separate computer terminals and are given written instructions, instructions are also read aloud to them.
2. Each player first participates in in Session 1, which is a series of one shot games against anonymous players. These games are similar to battle of the sexes, but use a 3x3 matrix for decisions instead of the 2x2.  Session 1 is complete after each player plays every other player.
3. After each game is complete, the lottery is drawn and winning players are awarded $1, losers are awarded nothing.
4. In session 2, each player plays twenty one-shot battle of the sexes games.  Each game consists of two periods where they placed one game as a row player and one game as a column player.
    1. In session 2, there were three types of communication allowed, and it was varied among the cohorts. First was no communication , where players were not permitted to send messages before the game the game was played.  The second was one way communication where the row player could chose to send or not send the column player a message.  After the decision was made, both plays made their decision simultaneously.  Finally there was two-way communication where both plays had the option to send or not a send a message, after the choice was made, with players made their choice of action.
5. After after each game is complete, the lottery is drawn and winning players are awarded $2, losers are awarded nothing

## Roles 
Participants all act as one player in a game where the other player is unknown to them.  They play one game as a column player, and another as a row player before the period ends, and they move on to player another person.

## Instructions
For Session 1:  
You are set to participate in an experiment in the economics of decision making.  There are two phases, in the first phase you are paired with another participant and based on your combined actions, you will both earn points.  In phase two you your payout will be decided.  
- Phase 1:
    - In each decision making period you will be paired with another player, one of you will be designated player B and the other player S.  Both of you will make a decision and the combination of your decisions will decide the number of points earned for each player.  You alternate between B and S each period. 
    - For today you will be participating in a series of separate sessions, for session one, you will play each person once.  You will not be able to identify your opponent.
    - You are given a set of record sheets, you will record whether you are player B or S and the period number, this will be displayed on your screen before the start of the period.
    - Each period you and the other player are both to select an action.  As player B you will have the option of selecting B1, B2 or B3, similarly if you are player S you will have the chance to select S1, S2 or S3.  The combination of your choices will decide the amount of points both of you earn for the period.  You will enter your action into the computer via the terminal.  Once both players have entered their choices into the computer, it will compute the score.  The results will be displayed along with player S’s selected action and you are to record your point earnings and the other players action on a record sheet.
- Phase 2:
    - After Phase 1 is complete you are to record your point earnings from Phase 1 on the Profit Sheet in the corresponding period row.  A lottery ticket will be drawn, and the number will be announced, you should record that number in the second column of the profit sheet.  If the number drawn is less than or equal to the number of points earned in phase 1, circle the $1.00 in the next column, otherwise circle the $0.00.  Any erasure will invalidate your earnings for the period.  If you make a mistake and circle the wrong number call it to an experimenters attention.
    - At the end of session one, total your dollar amounts, and enter that number on row 23 of the profit sheet.  All dollars in excess of $2.00 are yours to keep, subtract $2.00 from your total and record that number on row 25.

For Session 2 (Battle of the Sexes):  
In this session you will again experience a series of decision making periods, each period consisting of two phases.  In phase 2 you will be able to earn money based on the points earned in phase 1.  Both phases are similar to the phases described in Session 1, the difference will be described in the following sections.
- Phase 1 differs in the following ways:
    - The number of points earned will be given by different tables.
    - You will only have two choices, for S you will have S1, S2 and for B you will have B1 and B2.
    - You will play with every other person twice, once as B and once as S.
    - Communication channels:
        - 1-Way Communication: 
        - The phase 1 portion consists of two stages, in the first stage player B can chose to make an announcement to player S.  Player B can chose to announce their decision, ie. B1 or B2.  Player B will receive the prompt,
        - DO YOU WISH TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT?
        - If you select no, it will make the announcement for the period, if yes it will prompt,
        - WHAT DO YOU WISH TO ANNOUNCE?
        - You may enter B1 or B2.  After B has made their decision, player S will receive a message saying whether or not B has chosen to make an announcement and if so, they will see player B’s action.  It will them move to stage 2 where you play the game as before.
        - 2-Way-1-Round Communication:
        - Once again phase 1 will consist of 2 stages.  In the first stage each player will be prompted, asking whether or not they wish to make and announcement,
        - DO YOU WISH TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT?
        - If you select no, it will make the announcement for the period, if yes it will prompt,
        - WHAT DO YOU WISH TO ANNOUNCE?
        - If you are player B, you may enter B1 or B2, if you are player S you may enter S1 or S2.  After all players have made a decision on whether or not they want to make an announcement, the other player will receive a message about whether or not the other player made an announcement and if so, it will contain their announcement.  It will then move to stage 2 where you play the game as before.
        - 2-Way-3-Round Communication:
        - Once again phase 1 will consist of 2 stages.  This time the first stage will consist of three rounds. Meaning both players can make an announcement of their planned action for stage 2, three times.
- Phase 2 differs in the following ways:
    - It is exactly the same as session 1’s phase 2, except you can keep all money earned.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Success of a solution is easily measured.  During the game, the optimal solutions requires players work together to take their maximum payout one round and a less favorable payout the next.  This is easily done when the players can communicate, but is harder in one way communication, and no communication settings.

## Incentives
In Cooper et al. players were rewarded based on a lottery system, where the probability of winning was the players earned points, divided by 1000.  At the end of phase one, a player's points would be between 0 and 1000 points.  After phase 2 a ticket is randomly drawn (tickets are numbered from 0 to 1000) if the players points are greater than or equal to the number on the drawn ticket, the player wins $1.00, otherwise the player wins nothing.
