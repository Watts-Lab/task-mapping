# Summary
In the Battle of the Sexes game, two players participate in a simple game.  Each player is to make a choice that will impact both them, and the person they are playing with.  The objective is to act cooperatively so that both players can reach their optimal solution.

Players are more likely to act cooperatively if they know the other person is making some sacrifice for them, on the other hand if they believe the other player is acting maliciously, they are likely to do the same.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are positioned at separate computer terminals and are given written instructions, instructions are also read aloud to them.
2. Each player first participates in in Session 1, which is a series of one shot games against anonymous players. These games are similar to battle of the sexes, but use a 3x3 matrix for decisions instead of the 2x2.  Session 1 is complete after each player plays every other player.
3. After session 1 is complete, the lottery is drawn and winning players are awarded $1, losers are awarded nothing
4. In session 2, each player plays twenty one-shot battle of the sexes games.  Each game consists of two periods where they placed one game as a row player and one game as a column player.
    1. In session 2, there were three types of communication allowed, and it was varied among the cohorts. First was no communication , where players were not permitted to send messages before the game the game was played.  The second was one way communication where the row player could chose to send or not send the column player a message.  After the decision was made, both plays made their decision simultaneously.  Finally there was two-way communication where both plays had the option to send or not a send a message, after the choice was made, with players made their choice of action.
5. After session 2 is complete, the lottery is drawn and winning players are awarded $2, losers are awarded nothing

## Roles 
Participants all act as one player in a game where the other player is unknown to them.  They play one game as a column player, and another as a row player before the period ends, and they move on to player another person.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Success of a solution is easily measured.  During the game, the optimal solutions requires players work together to take their maximum payout one round and a less favorable payout the next.  This is easily done when the players can communicate, but is harder in one way communication, and no communication settings.

## Incentives
In Cooper et al. players were rewarded based on a lottery system, where the probability of winning was the players earned points, divided by 1000.  At the end of phase one, a players points would be between 0 and 1000 points.  After phase 2 a ticket is randomly drawn (tickets are numbered from 0 to 1000) if the players points are greater than or equal to the number on the drawn ticket, the player wins $1.00, otherwise the player wins nothing.
