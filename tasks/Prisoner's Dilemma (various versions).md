# Summary
The N-person prisoners dilemma game is designed to mimic a situation where two prisoners were caught for jointly committing a felony. The two prisoners are held in separate rooms so that they cannot communicate.  The District Attorney cannot prove their guilt but offers each prisoner a plea deal.  If one confesses, they get to go free, but the other receives the maximum sentence.  If they both confess they receive a moderate sentence each.  If neither confess, both receive a minimum sentence.

## Steps
The “Take Some” Game
- Groups of three are formed.
- Players are briefed on the rules.
- Simultaneously each participant holds up a the blue or red poker chip.
    - For each red chip held up, the player holding the chip is awarded $3.00, but every participant in the group is penalized $1.00 (meaning if each participant holds up a red chip, the groups payout is 0).
    - For each blue chip held up, the participant holding it is awarded $1.00, and no one is penalized.
- Scores are tallied, and this can be repeated for as many rounds as the experimenter chooses.
The “Give Some” Game
- Participants are broken up into groups of five.
- Players are briefed on the rules.
- Each player decides whether to keep $8.00 from the experimenter, or give $3.00 to every other participant in the group.
- This is repeated for as many rounds as the experimenter chooses.
General Prisonniers Dilemma
- Generally played with two people, and can be played repeatedly.
- Designed to model a scenario where where two prisoners were caught for jointly committing a felony.
- The two prisoners are held in separate rooms so that they cannot communicate.  The District Attorney cannot prove their guilt but offers each prisoner a plea deal.  If one confesses, they get to go free, but the other receives the maximum sentence.  If they both confess they receive a moderate sentence each.  If neither confess, both receive a minimum sentence.

## Roles 
Participants work independently within their groups, they can choose to be cooperative or act selfishly.

## Instructions
Instructions developed by CSS lab  

The “Take Some” Game
- In this game you and two other participants will work in a group.  
- Each round you will have a choice of holding up either the red or blue poker chip.  
- The red chip will award you $3.00, but will deducted $1.00 from each participant, including yourself.
- The blue chip will award you $1.00 and will not deduct anything from any participant.
- It is plain to see the benefits of sharing.
- Each participant will hold up their choice at the same time, and you will not know what the others are selecting before the round.
- The experiment will run for N rounds, and at the end your total amount earned will be tallied. 

The “Give Some” Game
- In this experiment you will work in a group with four other participants.
- In each round of the experiment you and every other participant will make an independent decision.  The decision will be your choice of two options. The options are as follows:
    - You can decide to take an $8.00 payout from the experimenter.
    - Or you can decide to give every other participant a $3.00 gift.
- It is plain to see the benefits of gifting if everyone is cooperative.
- The experiment will run for N rounds, and at the end your total amount earned will be tallied.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The performance of a group can be measured by their payout, i.e. how well they cooperate, and their ability to identify the most beneficial strategy.

## Incentives
The incentives to participate are based on the payouts in the experiments.
