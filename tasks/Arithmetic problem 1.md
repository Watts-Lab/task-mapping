# Summary
The participants in this task are to imagine that you are apart of a five man team. You and your teammates operate one of five machines, and each man spends most of the time operating on their preferred machine. When each man runs the machine he most prefers, the total time spent on each product is 16 minutes. The goal of this task is to find a more efficient way to complete the operation on one product by assigning each worker to a machine.

# Procedure
## Steps
>Partipants receive paper, pencil, and a copy of the instructions.
>They are then read the instructions, and given the name of either Walt, Steve, Dennis, Robert, or John.
>They are then to discuss to reach a decision, and then write their plan out in detail on the paper provided.

## Roles 
Each partipant has the same role

## Instructions
You are a five man team whose job is to manufacture a product, the completion of which requires the operation of five machines. In the past, you have rotated position to avoid boredom, but each man has spent most of the time operating the machine that he prefers. John prefers machine 3, Steve machine 2, Walt machine 4, Robert machine 1, and Dennis machine 5.

The Methods man has been around checking the time each man requires to complete the operation on one product when he is operating each of the five machines. He has come up with the following results:

Your foreman noticed that when each man runs the machine that he most prefers, the total time spent on each product is 16 minutes. It seems to him that a different method of operation would result in substantial savings. He believes in letting his workers make their own decision, in so far as possible, and has asked that you consider the problem and try to come up with a plan that will be more efficient than the present mode of operation.

Your task now is to examine the data provided by the Methods man and decide which person should operate which machine. When you have reached a decision, please write your plan out in detail on the paper provided. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Amount of time for total operation according to the plan decided upon (the more time, the less effective the plan); time required to reach a decision. 

Dimension:
Cooperation requirements, Decision verifiability, Difficulty, Goal clarity, Goal path multiplicity, Intellectual-manipulative requirements, Intrinsic interest, Operational requirements, Population familiarity, Solution multiplicity
