which of two cholesterol-reducing drugs should be marketed.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Group members’ initial decision preferences was manipulated by varying specific aspects of the information provided. The information sheets were constructed such that some of the facts were shared (provided to all three members) and some were unshared (provided to only one group member). The fact sheets varied with distributions that either mildly (weak incorrect preference condition) or strongly (strong incorrect preference condition) disagreed with the overall distribution of information available to the group. 

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants reported to the lab area in same-sex groups of 7 or 8. Six of these participants were randomly assigned to one of two triads to participate in the group discussions. The additional participants (when present) were assigned to an alternative experiment. 
2. Groups were randomly assigned to conditions and each participant was randomly assigned to a seat. The two group sessions were conducted in separate rooms by different experimenters and was video taped from behind a one way mirror. 
3. Once seated, participants read an introduction sheet that described the videotaping procedure and explained
that they would be participating in a role-playing simulation of managers in a pharmaceutical company trying to decide which of two drugs to market. They were told that both drugs were meant to reduce cholesterol levels and that each drug had certain benefits and certain risks. 
> To reduce the chances of participants rushing through the materials or the interaction in hope of early dismissal, groups were told that the session would take the full 1½ hours but that no one would be asked to stay longer than that time. (Sessions typically lasted about 1 hour and 20 minutes.)
4. Participants were then given a booklet containing some factual, background information on cholesterol, drugs meant to reduce cholesterol, and the drug marketing process. 
 > To increase the participants’ involvement in the task, the booklet also contained information about their pharmaceutical company, revealing that the company was in financial trouble and that their marketing decision was therefore especially important. Participants were given about 10 minutes to read through this information. 
5. Participants were asked to familiarize themselves with the information about the two drugs. Barriers were placed on the table between participants so that items could not be shared prior to the group discussion. 
6. Participants were told that because individuals in everyday decision-making groups rarely have identical knowledge about any particular issue, the information they were given was not necessarily the same as the information that other group members received.
  > However, participants were told that all of the information was accurate. Furthermore, they were told that they would be asked to recall the information about the two drugs later in the experiment. Participants were given 10 minutes to study the information sheets.
7. Prior to the group discussion, the fact sheets were collected and participants were asked to recall as many ofthe facts about each drug as they could and were given as much time as they needed for the recall task. 
8. Following the recall task, the barriers were removed and the groups were asked to discuss the problem and come to a group consensus about which drug to market.
9. They were told that it was very important to consider as much information as possible and to evaluate carefully the benefits and problems associated with each drug. 
10. The groups were then given one of the two time pressure manipulation instructions. The experimenter demonstrated how to use the intercom and told the group to signal over the intercom when it reached the final decision.
11. The experimenter then left the room, started the videotape camera, and started the session over the intercom.
12. After the group reached its final decision, barriers were placed between group members and they were asked to once again recall the original facts about the two drugs. 
13. Finally, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire that included a number of manipulation and process checks and items assessing perceptions of the interaction, as well as individual and group drug preferences. 
14. Participants were then debriefed and dismissed.

## Roles 
Not relevant to task.

## Instructions
**Time Pressure Instructions**

During your discussion, we would like to simulate the pressures and stress often experienced by everyday business decision-making teams. Therefore, we would like you to imagine that the president of your company has called a surprise meeting and has demanded that your group report its final decision about what drug to market at this meeting. For this reason, it is very important for your group to come to a decision as quickly as possible. The quality of your decision will be judged both on its correctness and on how quickly the decision was made.

**Non-Time Pressure**

Take as much time as you need to come to a decision that you are comfortable with and that you all are confident is correct.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Rate. A rate index was calculated by dividing the total number of facts discussed by the number of minutes in the group interaction time pressure groups vs. non-time pressure groups. All questionnaire items were assessed on 9-point scales.

Time pressure. 
1. Participants were asked to report how much time pressure they felt from 1 (none) to 9 (extreme).
2. Participants also were asked to report, again on a 9-point scale, whether they felt they had enough time to make a decision and the degree to which their group focused on completing the task quickly
3. Participants also were asked to assess the amount of stress they felt and to identify the source of their stress.

Initial preferences influence on group decisions. Group members were asked, after the discussion, to recall their prediscussion drug preferences.

Focus on diagnostic information. Group discussion time was analyzed to see whether positive, negative or neutral were given maximum weight in discussions.

Bias of group discussion. Group discussion was analyzed to see whether discussions were biased towards initial preferences by group members who only provided information supporting their bias.

Shared and unshared information. Since information was not uniform, discussions were analyzed to see what types of information (eg: diagnostic/ not diagnostic) was shared and what was not.

## Incentives
Participants partially fulfilled a course requirement by participating in the experiment.
