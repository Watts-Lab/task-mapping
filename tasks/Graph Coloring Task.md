# Summary
This study looked at the influence of structural properties on naturally occurring networks given their influence on behavior and dynamics. Through the use of network coloring problems subjects differentiated their color from neighbors and those generated by preferential attachment made solving the coloring problem more difficult than did networks based on cyclical structures, and "small worlds" networks were easier still. This indicates providing more information can have opposite effects on performance, depending on network structure.

# Procedure
## Steps

Subjects were given a series of coloring experiments based on the six topologies in the figure included above on computers 

Three of the six networks begin with a simply cycle and add a varying number or random chords while preserving two chromatic chords to represent “small worlds” networks. 

The fourth cycle is a more engineered and has a hierarchical structure, with two distinguished individuals
 having inordinately high connectivity. 

The fifth and sixth networks were developed based on the preferential attachment model in which vertices are highly connected and  tend to generate structural properties like “hubs”. 


Subjects sat at work stations and worked on a computer that showed a local view (subjects and their neighbors colors) of the current state

Subjects were familiarized with the coloring problem but were not given any instructions on how to play it 

Subjects could update their colors at any time from a menu that included the fixed minimum of colors needed to solve the problem and were given different neighbor views from low view (solely subject colors and their neighbors colors), medium view (neighbors colors and labeled and number of links are visible) and high information view (entire network colors visible)

## Roles 

N/A

## Instructions

Subjects were familiarized with the coloring problem but were not given any instructions on how to play it 

No communication was allowed outside the confines of the system and physical partitions were used to prevent subjects from seeing outside workstation 


The text at the bottom of each network screenshot reads as follows: "1 conflict in your immediate neighborhood. A thick line indicates a conflict that must be 
resolved. A thin line is shown when color choices do not conflict.” The bar at the bottom of each screen gave subjects an indication of global progress toward a 
solution.



# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Researchers reviewed, the number of colors required for solution, mean completion time of solved networks for each network, the statistics on the distribution of the degree (number of links) of each vertex and the average distance (number of links), network average distance (average shortest path distance measured in number of links traveled over all vertices),  the fraction of trials on which it was solved for each dimension and the number of steps (measured in color changes) for a natural distributed computer heuristic. 

## Incentives

In one session collective or global incentives were used, participants received $5 for each experiment that was colored successfully within the five minutes 
allocated. 

In the other session, individual and local incentives were used, participants received $5 if the experiment ended with their own color being different than 
their neighbors either at the time limit of five minutes or when the puzzle was solved. There are no noteworthy differences in the payment schemes used.
