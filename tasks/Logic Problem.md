# Summary
 This task examined how different coordination demands and how individual contributations could be combined into a group product. To do this, participants performed anagram and logic tasks.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Three variations of each type of task was used to prevent subjects in one group from communicating to another group
Study Two repeated the same tasks but with 2 or 10 person groups and with increased encouragement to communicate: Each subject was given 5 colored and 10 white cards for logic problems and 2 colored and 4 white cards for anagram problems. They instructed to deposit a card in a box each time he/she spoke. Subjects started with colored cards and when those were used up they moved to white cards

# Procedure
## Steps
 Randomly assign participants to work alone or in groups of 2, 5, or 10.
 
 Order of tasks was counterbalanced so some groups started with anagrams while others started with logic
 
 Participants completed 33 anagrams ranging from 5 to 14 letters in 5 minutes
  To keep coordination demands to a minimum, each member had a list of all the anagrams
  Each group member could work independently, and would announce the solution to be entered on a group sheet
 
 Participants would complete a logic problem by compiling information among the different group members and make 15 deductions to arrive at a solution in 25 minutes.
 
 Clues were distributed among different group members so that communication was required since clues had to be combined
 
 The clue enabled subjects to rule out all possibilities except one and to reach a correct deduction for the first sequential decision. This, when combined with other clues, allowed further deductions, which then led to a solution.
 
  An example of a logic problem:
   1. Pair first and last names with destinations to determine which five couples vacationed at various ski resorts
   2. Clues include: "Neither Tammy nor Sue vacationed in Innsbruck," and Both Rita and Mrs. Owens returned from their vacations with broken wrists."
 
 After each task, subjects completed a questionnaire describing group processes and their reaction to the task

## Roles 
All participants had the same role

## Instructions
 Anagram task
  Each participant was presented with a sheet with the entire list of anagrams. They were instructed to solve as many anagrams as they could and pool individual solutions to compile a group list of solutions. 

 Logic problem task
  Clues were distributed, and solutions could only be made by sharing and discussing clues. Participants were encouraged to collaborate and were provided a grid on a whiteboard that helped the group keep track of decisions that they made. 


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The anagram was scored based on the number of anagrams solved
The logic problem was scored based on the number of critical facts correctly deduced 

## Incentives
None listed
