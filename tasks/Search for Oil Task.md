# Summary
In the task, groups of four were to decide which of 144 sections of land, represented by a 12 by 12 matric on a 80-cm by 80-cm board, were suitable for drilling oil. When the team decided that a particular spot was suitable, a member pulled on of the tabs which appeared on every one of th 144 sections. If the team decided correctly, a red dot appeared on the reverse side oft he tab; otherwise, the tab was blank. There were 33 red dots altogether.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Subects came to the laboratory and were introduced to each other by name 
2. The experimenter explained that the purpose of the experiment was to understand how people make decisions in groups.
3. The subjects completed a translated version of Fiedler's (1967) LPC.
4. The experimenter informed the groups that they simulated an interdiciplinary team of scientists in a consulting firm whose task it was to choose areas of land in which there was a high probability of discovering oil.
5. Each member received a 12 by 12 map showing land sections fulilling only one of the four criteria that would have to be met in order for a red dot to appear on the tab (chemical composition of land, surface hardness, surface mantle thickness, and geological stratification)
6. They were given 1 minute to memorize the map without using a paper or pencil
7. Subjects were then told them whether they had 3, 5, or 15 minutes to complete the group task. They were informed that in the past groups without time limits had taken about 10 minutes to complete the same task comfortably.
8. Groups were then to decide which of the 144 desctions of land were suitable for drilling oit. WHen the team decided on a spot, a member pulled one of the tabs to see if there was a red dot or if the tab was blank. They were told that there were 33 red dots ("hits") altogether
9.  The subjects were paid according to the number of accurate recommendations they made, and for each mistake they would lose moey (points)
10.  They were asked to complete a 7-point scale for sociometric ratings and 6 7-point scales to assess group process


## Roles 
Two observers: each observed two of the four group members

## Instructions
Ask

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
1. Decision-making accuracy: assessed by number of hits (finds), misses (mistakes), frequencies of hits and misses (hits/min and misses/min) and two indices of efficiency, misses/hit and (hits-misses)/(hits+misses)
2. Amount of communication: one communication tally for every complete phrase, purposeful pointing to a space, or phrase plus pointing to a space
3. Sociometric ratings: 7-point scales in which members rated their own willingness to work with each other on a similar task, or to participate with him or her in a social function
4. Group process: 6 7 point-scales assessed leadership, satisfaction with the group's output, satisfaction with the way the team functioned, pleasantness of the task, amount of stress each member experiences, and time-sufficience.
