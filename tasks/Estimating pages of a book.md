# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations. 

If no visual components are provided or seem not to be needed describe an interface for executing this task in an online environment with remote participants. 

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Each of the 68 groups was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: face-to-face or online. All participants were seated in front of personal laptop computers and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the tasks described below. 
> Each face-to-face group was seated in a private room around a small table and was allowed to communicate freely.
>  Members in the online groups were randomly seated in a large room with members of other groups. They did not know who else was in their group, and they only communicated with their group members via text chat in the shared online system. 
2. Groups are asked to judge the number of pages in books based on images of their page edges. 
> The groups receive points proportional to the number of book pages that their estimate erred, corrected for the total number of pages in the book (i.e. 10 pages wrong out of a 400-page book is a smaller error than 10 pages wrong out of a 50-page book). 
3. The combined time for all judgment tasks was 10 minutes

## Instructions
Instructions written by CSS Lab 

As a group you will need to judge the number of pages in books based on images of their page edges. 

You will earn points based on how close your estimate is to the actual pages in each book. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The groups receive points proportional to the number of book pages that their estimate erred, corrected for the total number of pages in the book (i.e. 10 pages wrong out of a 400-page book is a smaller error than 10 pages wrong out of a 50-page book).
