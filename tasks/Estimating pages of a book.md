# Stimuli
## The visual components
CSS lab will need to find images of books.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Each of the 68 groups was randomly assigned to one of two conditions: face-to-face or online. All participants were seated in front of personal laptop computers and worked with their group members in a shared online system to complete the tasks described below. 
> Each face-to-face group was seated in a private room around a small table and was allowed to communicate freely.
> Members in the online groups were randomly seated in a large room with members of other groups. They did not know who else was in their group, and they only communicated with their group members via text chat in the shared online system. 
2. Groups are asked to judge the number of pages in books based on images of their page edges. 
> The groups receive points proportional to the number of book pages that their estimate erred, corrected for the total number of pages in the book (i.e. 10 pages wrong out of a 400-page book is a smaller error than 10 pages wrong out of a 50-page book). 
3. The combined time for all judgment tasks was 10 minutes (three tasks in total).

## Instructions
Instructions written by CSS Lab 

As a group you will need to judge the number of pages in books based on images of their page edges. 

You will earn points based on how close your estimate is to the actual pages in each book. 

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The groups receive points proportional to the number of book pages that their estimate erred, corrected for the total number of pages in the book (i.e. 10 pages wrong out of a 400-page book is a smaller error than 10 pages wrong out of a 50-page book). 
 

## Incentives
All participants were paid for their participation and their written informed consent was obtained before the start of the session.
