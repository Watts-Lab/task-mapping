# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were instructed that they were to negotiate the contents of an employment package. 
2. They were randomly assigned the role of either the recruit or the recruiter. At this time, all participants received a package of material containing their confidential instructions and negotiation role information.
3.  In the confidential instructions, participants in the 4-issue condition were instructed that 4 issues were to be negotiated. 
4.  Likewise, participants in the 8-issue condition were instructed that 8 issues were to be negotiated. I
5.  n both conditions, participants were explicitly instructed that their goal was to maximize their (individual) payoff and that they had one week in which to complete the negotiation.


Background on negotiation: 
The negotiation task, New Recruit (Neale, 1997), involves the negotiation of an employment package. The New Recruit case has 8 issues—unknown to the participants, the payoffs are such that 2 issues are purely distributive (i.e., one person’s gain comes at the other’s loss), 2 issues are purely compatible (i.e., both parties want the same thing), and 4 issues have optimal logrolling potential. 
> This case was used as published in the 8-issue condition, and a modified version of it was used in the 4-issue condition. The modified case was adjusted such that it had only 4 issues yet the type of issues negotiated were consistent across the experimental manipulation. That is, participants in the 4-issue condition negotiated one issue that was purely distributive, one that was purely compatible, and 2 issues that had optimal logrolling potential. The 8-issue condition had these same types of issues except twice as many. In short, both conditions negotiated the same types of issues.

It should also be noted that the specific 4 issues (out of 8 possible) negotiated in the 4-issue condition were counterbalanced across participants in the 4-issue condition. That is, whereas half of the participants in the 4-issue condition negotiated a specific subset of the 4 out of 8 possible issues, the remaining participants in this condition negotiated the opposing subset of 4 issues.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Satisfaction. Participants’ post-negotiation satisfaction levels were measured by responses to three questions that were averaged into an overall satisfaction index measure (α=.82) ranging from 1 (low satisfaction) to 7 (high satisfaction).
> satisfaction was measured by participants’ willingness to have a continued relationship with the other party. A negotiator’s desire to have a future relationship with the other party has been found to be primarily a function of negotiator satisfaction
> Finally, an independent third party assessed negotiator satisfaction. After completing the negotiation and the post-negotiation questionnaire, participants were asked in an open-ended question to summarize their thoughts regarding the negotiation. 

Counterfactual thoughts. In order to verify the existence and the extent to which subjects had counterfactual thoughts, also measured were subjects’ ratings of the extent to which they had thoughts about how the situation could have occurred with a better outcome. Counterfactual thoughts were measured by responses to two questions that were aggregated into an overall counterfactual thought index measure (α=.79).

Controllability. Perceptions of controllability were measured by participants’ responses to the following single item question: “To what degree do you feel you were able to personally manipulate and influence the outcome of this negotiation?” Responses were recorded on a scale of 1 (“not at all”) to 7 (“absolutely completely”).
