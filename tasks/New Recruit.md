# Summary
The negotiation task, New Recruit involves the negotiation of an employment package. Participants were instructed that they were to negotiate the contents of an employment package. They were randomly assigned the role of either the recruit or the recruiter.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants were instructed that they were to negotiate the contents of an employment package. 
2. Within each experimental session, participants were randomly paired for the negotiation, resulting in 82 dyads. They were randomly assigned the role of either the recruit or the recruiter.
3. There were six issues on which participants must reach agreement: these included one distributive, or “fixed-sum,” issue on which the parties’ interests were mutually opposing; one congruent issue on which the parties’ interests were aligned; and four integrative, or “pie-expanding,” issues on which the parties could make trade-offs that maximized both individual and overall value by logrolling among two pairs of issues with asymmetric points. 
4. Participants received a list of settlement options for each issue, and the payoff (in points) associated with each option. They saw only their own payoff schedule, and were not aware of their counterparts’.
5. Participants were explicitly instructed that their goal was to maximize their (individual) payoff, and were given 30 minutes to conduct their negotiation.

**Background on negotiation** 

1. Dyads negotiated a simulated job offer (the “New Recruit” exercise; Neale, 1997). Dyads were assigned to one cell of a 2 (candidate emotion: happy vs. angry) × 2 (recruiter emotion: happy vs. angry) × 2 (power distribution: candidate high/recruiter low vs. candidate low/recruiter high) design; however, as explained below, the unit of analysis is generally the individual negotiator. Each participant’s emotion was manipulated through instructions. Dyads always contained one high- and one low-power negotiator; the role associated with each power level was counterbalanced. Power was manipulated through both alternative opportunities available to the negotiator and a narrative description of the power discrepancy between the two roles.
2. In addition to reading about the issues to be negotiated and their associated point values, participants also read instructions that conveyed our power and emotion manipulations. These were delivered as two last-minute, urgent messages, separate from the main case materials; each participant received his or her own messages, and were not given any information about the other participant’s messages. Although many novice negotiators typically assume that the recruiter is more powerful than the candidate, we wanted to manipulate power independently from role. Therefore, regardless of the assigned role, participants were randomly assigned to the high-power or low-power condition.
3. After completing the negotiation, participants were given a post-negotiation questionnaire that asked them to report their reactions to and feelings about the negotiation. They completed this questionnaire, which took about 10 min, and then were paid, thanked, and debriefed.


## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
Please see negotiation website for full instructions, below are the performance criteria questions:

1.“How much power did you feel that YOU had in this negotiation?”

2. Rate how much you are feeling the following emotions on a 1–7 scale with 7 = “a lot,”.
happy, excited, lively, content, cheerful, pleased, satisfied, unhappy, sad, bored, hostile, angry, and stubborn.

Participants were asked about how they responded to their counterparts. These responses were designed to capture two categories, focus and getting tough.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Integrative and Distributive Behavior: Videotape coding was used to measure observable, behavioral integrativeness in the negotiation. 

> Coders were trained to distinguish between distributive and integrative behavior using dimensions derived from the past frames cited above, especially that of Weingart and colleagues (1999): making single-issue offers vs making multiple-issue offers; stating priorities vs stating positions; asking diagnostic questions vs justifying one’s offer. Specifically, the two coders received a chart listing these and other particular acts; the acts were grouped into “more integrative” and “more distributive” categories.
These codes used 5-point scales to assess the degree to which each party was cooperative, where 5 = significant emphasis on the counterpart’s concerns; and the degree to which each party showed effort and perseverance, where 5 = repeated evidence of initiative and motivation to reach a deal. A third 5-point scale assessed coders’ overall impression of each negotiator, with 5 representing an overall impression of strong integrativeness.


Emotional Display: as further manipulation checks, coders rated each negotiator’s display of anger and happiness on separate 6-point scales, where 5 = a prolonged, intense display of that emotion and 0 = neutral affect.

## Incentives
The students were paid $10 for participating in the study.
