# Summary
In this task, participants were given a mathematical problem and were asked to solve the problem as a group. The problem involved figuring out the order of five girls for an examination from the given one true and one untrue statement made by each girl.

## The visual components
The following mathematical problem is provided to the participant:

Five school girls sat for an examination. Their parents, so they thought, showed an undue degree of interest in the result. They therefore agreed that, in writing home about the examination, each girl would make one true statement and one untrue one. The following are the relevant passages from their letters:

Betty: 'Kitty was second in the examination. I was only third.'
Ethel: 'You'll be glad to hear that I was top. Joan was second'
Joan: 'I was third, and poor Ethel was bottom.'
Kitty: 'I came out second. Mary was only fourth.'
Mary: 'I was fourth. Top place was taken by Betty.'

What, in fact, was the order in which the five girls placed?

# Procedure
## Steps
1. 49 judges who sorted 104 tasks into eight categories (or piles) representing different positions on the dimension under consideration. 
2. Each judge sorted the tasks on all dimensions, but no one sorted tasks on more than one dimension on a given day, and usually the sortings were separated by several days. 
3. The orders in which dimensions were sorted by the various judges were random, and the set of tasks was shuffled by E before each sorting. 
4. Each task was typed on a separate sheet which included all the information  
5. For a given dimension, the judge was given the set of tasks, a definition of dimension (exactly as given above), and a copy of the Archives of the History of American Psychology, The Center for the History of Psychology, The University of Akron CHP Special Interest Collection 
6. When the sorting had been completed, the judge placed each pile of tasks in an appropriately labeled manila envelope and returned them to E, who recorded the responses.

## Instructions
Overall sorting instructions: 
1. The sheets you have been given contain information about group tasks. These have been  selected  from a variety  of  tasks  used  in  small  group research  projects  reported  in  psychological  journals.

As a first step in assigning scale values to these tasks, we want  a number  of persons  to  sort  them  into  8 piles.  You  will  probably  find  it easier  to  sort  them  if you  look over  a  number  of  tasks, chosen  at random,  before  you begin  to  sort.  

2. Steps in sorting: 
> a. You have been given 8 manila envelopes with letters on them. Please  arrange  these  before  you  in regular  order.  
> b. Begin by sorting the tasks into four piles^ On envelope A place  those  tasks  that  you believe  are highest  with  regard  to  the dimension  (name  of  dimension).   On envelope  C  place  the  tasks  that  are  next  highest  on  this dimension;   on   envelope  E those  that  are  next highest;   and  on  envelope  G  those  that  are  lowest with  regard  to  the  dimension  (name  of  dimension).  
> c. When you have completed step b, divide each of the piles into  two more  piles  to make  a total  of  8 piles more  or  less  evenly  distributed  T,lor)g>tho  scale.  For  example,  those  tasks  you have  placed  on  envelope  A  should  be divided  so  that  those  that  are highest  on  the dimension  in  question  are  placed  on  A  and  those  that  are next highest  are  placed  on B;   similarly,  those  on envelope  C  are  divided  and  placed  on envelopes  C  and  J; etc. 
> d. Reconsider, look back and forth from pile to pile, reshuffle tasks  as much  as may  be  necessary  to be  sure  that  you  have  each  task  in the pile  that  you  think  it  should  be  in. 

3. DO NOT TRY TO GST THE SAME NUMBER IN SACK PILE. THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY  EVENLY DISTRIBUTED  ALONG  THE  DIMENSION.  

4. In any case in which you may consider it important, you may assume  the  following  conditions: 
>  a. The instructions listed on the task sheet are minimal; it  is  assumed  that  they  are understood  by  all  group members.
>  b. The first of the several criteria listed is the one to be useo  in evaluating  group performance  on  the  task.  
>  c. The size of the group is five persons. 
>  d. Subjects are selected randomly from a population of college undergraduates. 
>  e. The  group  is unstructured;   that  is, no  structure  is  imposed  on  the group,  no  leader  is assigned,  no restrictions  are  placed  on  communication  channels, etc., except  as  specified  on  the  task  information  sheet

5. When you have completed the sorting, please place each pile in the  corresponding  envelope  and  return  to me.

Mathematical puzzle 2 instructions: 
We are interested in observing how groups of individuals go about solving problems. Please read the problem carefully, then discuss it among yourselves and try to arrive at a group decision as quickly as possible. You may attack the problem in any way that you wish as long as you work on it as a group.
