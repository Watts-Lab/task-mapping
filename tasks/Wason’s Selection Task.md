# Summary
Two experiments were carried out to investigate the difficulty of making the contrapositive inference from conditional sentences of the form, “if P then Q.” For the selection task in experiment 1, the subjects were asked to decide which of four cards (P, P', Q, Q') would enable them to determine whether a given conditional sentence was true or false if they were to know the values on the back of the cards. In experiment 2, the subjects were asked to select a card that proves the given conditional sentence false and then select a card that proves the conditional sentence false.

## The visual components

*Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity*

Two conditional sentences were typed on separate cards (5 x 3 in.):
(1) “If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side.” 
(2) “If there is a 3 on one side of any card, then there is a D on its other side.”

Four cards (2 x 2 in.) associated with the two sentences (1)(2) had the following letters and numbers on their front and (in brackets) on their back:
(1) D(3), 3(K), B(5), 7(D)
(2) 3(D), K(3), 5(B), D(7)

*Experiment 2 - The restricted contingency programme*

Two conditional sentences were typed on separate cards similar to those used in Experiment 1: 
(1) “If there is a square on one side of the card, then there is a red scribble on the other side.” 
(2) “If there is a red scribble on one side of a card, then there is a square on the other side.” 

Four programme cards were prepared for the experimental group which had the following stimuli on either side: 
(a) square, yellow scribble
(b) square, red scribble 
(c) rectangle, red scribble 
(d) hexagon, brown scribble 

Eight similar cards were prepared for the selection task, the items mentioned first being on the front of the cards, and the items mentioned second (in brackets) being on the back: 
(a) square (red scribble) 
(b) square (brown scribble) 
(c) red scribble (square) 
(d) red scribble (hexagon) 
(e) green scribble (rectangle) 
(f) parellelogram (yellow scribble)
(g) triangle (red scribble)
(h) blue scribble (square)

# Procedure
## Steps

*Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity*

The subjects were allocated alternately to the groups and tested individually. Half the subjects in each group were tested with sentence (1) and half with sentence (2). 

1. The sentence was placed on the desk and the four test cards were placed in a line in a random order face upwards in front of the sentence. 
2. The subjects were told that cards with letters on their front had numbers on their back and vice uersa. 
3. In the selection task the experimenter pointed to each card in turn and asked the subject whether knowing what was on the other side would enable him to find out whether the sentence was true or false. 
4. In the experimental group, the experimenter pointed to each card and asked the subject to name a letter (or number) on the other side which would make the sentence false, or to say “none,” if none would do so.

*Experiment 2 - The restricted contingency programme*

The subjects were allocated alternately to the groups and tested individually. Six subjects in the experimental group were tested with sentence (1) and seven
with sentence (2), these proportions being reversed in the control group. 

1. Before presenting the conditional sentence the subjects in both groups examined the cards briefly to familiarize them with the fact that there was always a geometric shape on one side and a coloured scribble on the other side.
2. In the experimental group the conditional sentence was presented and the four programme cards were handed to the subjects who were asked to pick out “the one card which makes the rule false” (i.e. falsifies the conditional sentence). 
3. They were then asked to pick out any which “prove the rule true.” It was explained to them that their decisions meant that the converse of the sentence could not be assumed - “that the rule only held one way.” 
4. The subjects in the control group were given a similar amount of time to understand the conditional sentence without any explanation of its meaning.

The selection task had three phases which were the same for both groups.

**Phase I.** The eight selection task cards were placed on the desk front side up in a random array, and the subject was asked to pick out “all those cards, but only those cards, which would show you, if you knew what was on the other side, that the rule was true or false.”

**Phase 2.** The subject was asked to turn over all those cards which he had selected and evaluate the conditional sentence with respect to each: “tell me whether each proves the rule true or proves it false.”

**Phase 3.** The subject was invited to project falsity on to the residual cards i.e. those cards which had not been selected. Each pair of cards (representing the same value) was pointed to in turn, starting with the Q' cards, if these had not been selected: “could anything on the back of those cards make the rule false?”

## Instructions

Instruction written by CSSLab:

*Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity*

Thank you for participating in this experiment today. We are looking to understand how people making the contrapositive inference from conditional sentences of the form, “if P then Q.” You will be allocated alternately to a group or to work individually. The sentence placed on the desk in front of you is the conditional sentence you will analyze in this experiment. Cards on the desk with letters on their front have numbers on their back and vice versa. Your task is to determine for each of the card whether knowing what is on the other side would enable you to find out whether the conditional sentence is true or false.  

(After the selection is carried out)

To the experimental group:
"What letter/number on the back of the card do you think would render the sentence false? Or none if you believe none would do so."
"You are allowed to revise your selection now if you would like to."
"You are now allowed to turn over each card to evaluate the sentence to true or false."

To the control group:
"Now you are given some time to think again about your selection and make any adjustment before submitting your final choices."

*Experiment 2 - The restricted contingency programme*

Thank you for participating in this experiment today. We are looking to understand how people making the contrapositive inference from conditional sentences of the form, “if P then Q.” You will be allocated alternately to a group or to work individually. You will be presented with a conditional sentence and four cards that are with a geometric shape on one side and a coloured scribble on the other side. Your task is to select the one card which makes the rule false and any cards that make the rule true. You are allowed to examine the cards briefly before presented with the sentence you need to analyze. 

To the experimental group:
(During the selection) "Please pick out any cards that would prove the rule true. Please note that your decisions means that the rule only held one way.”

*Also, refer to the three phases mentioned in Steps*

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

In Experiment 1, participants are considered to be able to make the contrapositive inference from the conditional sentences if they choose Q' to determine whether a given conditional sentence was true of false if they were to know the values on the back of the cards. 

In Experiment 2, participants are considered to correctly making the contrapositive inference from the conditional sentences if they correctly choose PQ' to prove the given conditional sentence false or correctly choose PQ to prove the given conditional sentence true.

## Incentives
No incentives were mentioned for either experiment.
