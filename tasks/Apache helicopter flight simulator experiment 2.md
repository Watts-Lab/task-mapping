# Summary
Participants used a low-fidelity tank battle simulation called Team Wargame Interaction Simulation Training in groups of 3. Teams were asked to take over enemy pillboxes, pick them up, and relocate them in friendly territory, where they were rebuilt as allied weapons in the simulation. The paper varied the cross-training of participants.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations. 

If no visual components are provided or seem not to be needed describe an interface for executing this task in an online environment with remote participants. 


# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants received 2 hr of individual skills training on tank driving, weapon systems, and team strategies for movement across the battlefield and capturing enemies. Experimenters used coaching and task checklists to ensure that teams reached a basic level of competency on the simulation before advancing further in the experiment
2. Teams received the cross-training manipulation followed by a 35-min practice session. Teams in the positional rotation condition spent 14 min of this practice period in other members’ roles (7 min per role).
3. Team members then individually responded to manipulation check items and completed concept maps.
4. Teams took part in a 40-min performance period completing the task.

## Roles 
Three non-distinct roles: not all team members had the ability to shoot in the tank, and only one team member could build defense systems.


## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

If the instructions are not available ask the paper's authors, however and if that fails, write new ones that appear as suitable as possible.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
## Experiment 2
Cross-Training Effectiveness: . Cross-training effects were evaluated by participant responses to the following statements: “I understand the responsibilities of my teammates” and “I would feel comfortable switching roles with [my teammate].” Responses were made on a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Shared Team Interation Model: Participants were asked to choose from 50 concepts important to team interaction and place 12 of them in a prespecified hierarchical structure illustrating the sequence of task-related activities required to accomplish their mission. Examples of concepts included the following: travel in V formation, build barriers, shoot pillbox, and ambush from forest. Overlap in team members’ concept maps was assessed by the percentage of shared concepts placed identically on the concept maps. Higher scores on the mental model measure (ranged from 0% to 100%) indicated that a greater percentage of concepts were shared by all three members of a team.

Coordination: The measure of team coordination used for this study was a computer-logged objective index of tank distance from the other two tanks on the battlefield. Coordination indices were objectively computed every minute over the course of a 40-min performance mission and then averaged. Scores were reversed before statistical analysis so that higher scores would represent less dispersion and thus better coordination.

Team performance: Teams were scored 0 to 15, gaining 1 point or every pillbox they captured and rebuilt. 

## Incentives
A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   

Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
