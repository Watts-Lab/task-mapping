# Summary
Participants are divided into a group during phase one based on a trivial criteria. They then partake in a second task of goods distribution where the objective is to avoid objective influences during the good allocation.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Researchers created two hypothetical groups, 'Group A' and 'Group B'. Group assignment was random. The members of the groups were all hypothetical people, and therefore, they had no distinguishable differences. The researchers then chose some members of each group at random to leave their original group and join the opposite group; these members were referred to as migrants. Participants then rated each group member on a seven-point Likert scale for favorability. Migrants were rated as significantly less favorable than non-migrants.

In one study, participants were divided into two minimal groups. Each group was given two positive traits and two negative traits. Participants rated their own group as well as estimating ratings for the other group. They also estimated the minimum and maximum ratings for the traits in each group. Participants rated their own group higher on the positive traits and lower on the negative traits. The findings also showed that raters perceived higher variability among their own group's negative traits as well as the out-group's positive traits. The ratings showed that participants viewed their own group more positively as well as more diverse than the out-group.

# Procedure
## Steps
The traditional minimal group study consists of two phases.
1. In the first phase, participants are randomly and anonymously divided into two groups (e.g., "Group A" and "Group B"), ostensibly on the basis of trivial criteria (e.g., preference for paintings or the toss of a coin). 
2. Sometimes, these participants are strangers to one another. 
3. In the second phase, participants take part in an ostensibly unrelated resource distribution task. 
4. During this task, participants distribute a valuable resource (e.g., money or points) between other participants who are only identified by code number and group membership (e.g., "participant number 34 of Group A").
5. Participants are told that, after the task is finished, they will receive the total amount of the resource that has been allocated to them by the other participants.
