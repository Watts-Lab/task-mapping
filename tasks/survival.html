  <strong>The following steps appear over the course of the task.</strong> The
  participants would have just completed an individual version of the same
  activity.

<p>
  You and 3 other survivors have decided to form a team and work together.
  Discuss your situation amongst each other and agree on a team ranking of the
  same 10 items you just ranked individually. Submit the final ranking using the
  instructions below. You have 15 minutes!
</p>

<p>
  Record the group ranking by typing a message starting with "!" followed by a
  list of the item's acronyms. The item acronyms appear in the list below,
  inside the "()," to the right of the item name. Order this list from the MOST
  to the LEAST important item. Separate each item acronym with a space. For
  example, a correct submission message looks like:
  <code>!AB CD E F GH I J KL M N</code>
</p>

<p>
  Anyone in the group can submit the team ranking. You may submit the team item
  ranking as many times as needed. We will only look at the last submission.

  The situation described is based an over 2,000 actual cases in which men or
  women lived or died depending on the survival decisions they made. Your own
  ‘life’ or ‘death’ will depend on how well your team can share knowledge to
  reach collective decisions.

  It is approximately 10.00 am in mid-July and you have just crash-landed in the
  Sonora Desert, South West USA. Your light twin-engine plane containing the
  bodies of the pilot and co-pilot has completely burnt out, only the frame
  remaining. None of the rest of you has been injured. The pilot was unable to
  notify anyone of your position before you crashed. However, ground sightings
  taken shortly before the crash suggested that you are about 65 miles off
  course from your originally filed flight plan. A few moments before the crash
  the pilot indicated that the nearest known habitation is a mining camp 70
  miles away in a North-North-East direction. The immediate area is quite flat
  and appears to be rather barren except for the occasional cactus. The last
  weather report indicated that the temperature would reach 110°F. (43°C) You
  are dressed in light-weight clothing, short-sleeved shirts, shorts, socks, and
  leather shoes.
</p>

<p>
  Your team task is to rank the 10 items in order of their importance for your
  group's survival as you all wait to be rescued.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cosmetic Mirror (CM)</li>
  <li>.45 Caliber Pistol (CP)</li>
  <li>1 Plastic Raincoat (PR)</li>
  <li>1 Red and White Parachute (P)</li>

  <li>Flashlight (F)</li>
  <li>A book entitled Edible Animals of the Desert (B)</li>
  <li>1 Pair of Sunglasses per person (S)</li>
  <li>1 Quart of Water per person (Q)</li>
  <li>100 Salt Tablets (ST)</li>
</ul>

<p>Say hello to your team! Begin brainstorming item rankings together.</p>

<p>
  PLEASE NOTE: To receive the stated pay, you must show a concerted and honest
  effort to engage with your team and advance team discussion beyond the obvious
</p>

<p>
  As a team, discuss and refine your team ranking. Collaborate to give your team
  the best chance at survival. We take your final ranking submission.
</p>

<p>
  Any teammate may submit the ranking by adding a <code>!</code> in front of the
  list of item acronyms from MOST to LEAST important. For example,
</p>

<p><code>!AB CD E F GH I J KL M N</code></p>

<p>
  This round is ending soon! Make sure you've submitted your team ranking.
