# Summary
Participants first viewed a video describing a survival scenario in which a plane crashes in the desert and various items are salvaged from the wreckage. Participants were then tasked with rank ordering these 16 items (e.g., water, machete, compass, and cosmetic mirror) in the order of most to least importance for survival in the described scenario first individually and then as groups.

# Procedure
## Steps
The procedure was as follows: 
1. Participants first viewed a video describing a survival scenario in which a plane crashes in the desert and various items are salvaged from the wreckage. 
2. Individuals were then tasked with rank ordering these 16 items (e.g., water, machete, compass, and cosmetic mirror) in the order of most to
least importance for survival in the described scenario. 
3. Participants then had 5 minutes to complete their individual rankings (i.e., they worked independently). 
4. They then completed the same ranking with their fellow group members; groups had 10 minutes to discuss the task and collectively complete the ranking.

## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
"It is approximately 10 o'clock in the morning on a mid-August day and you have just crash-landed in the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States."

Your task is to rank 16 items salvaged from the plane in the order of their importance to your team's survival.


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Individuals: 
- Expertise. Individual expertise scores were calculated by summing the absolute values of the differences in each individual’s ranking of the various items (collected before the group discussion) and the expert ranking for each item.
- Participation. Each participant wore a personal microphone which recorded the group discussion portion of the task.
- Influence. Individual influence on the group’s final group decision was calculated by summing the absolute values of the differences in the initial individual ranking and the final group ranking for each item.
- Gender & Race Dissimilarity.

Group:
- Performance: We focus specifically on how well groups performed relative to the expertise available within the group by using a measure of “strong synergy,” which is measured by comparing the group’s raw performance with its best individual’s raw performance
- Group diversity—gender:  We measured gender diversity by calculating group gender variety with Blau’s index (Blau, 1977), which represents the probability that two individuals taken at random from the group will be different genders. Higher numbers indicate higher levels of diversity.
- Participation pattern: The alignment of expertise and participation reflects the within-group correlation of individual expertise and individual speaking amounts; scores range from 21 to 1, and higher scores indicate a closer match between relative expertise and speaking amounts.
- Influence pattern: The alignment of expertise and influence reflects the within-group correlation of individual expertise and individual influence; scores range from 21 to 1, and higher scores indicate a closer match between relative expertise and influence.
- Group diversity—race: We calculated a group’s race diversity with respect to the race variety withinthe group using Blau’s index (Blau, 1977). Specifically, we make use of all seven categories of race in our sample (white, black, Asian, Indian, Hispanic, mixed race, and other) to capture the richest measure of race variety within a group.

## Incentives
Participants received $20 for participation.
