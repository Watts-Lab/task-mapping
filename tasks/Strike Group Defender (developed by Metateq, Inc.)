# Summary
Participants play a video game in which they enhance their ability to employ defensive countermeasures against a variety of missiles. Each type of enemy missile had a corresponding countermeasure. Successful defense required the player to identify the missile type, heading, and time-to-impact, and then deploy the appropriate countermeasure in a suitable location during a specific window of time. 

The game allowed for multiple players to participate in a single scenario, which created an environment that would benefit from teamwork. The participants were tasked to defend the strike group from incoming missiles while working with a partner that they believed to be either human or autonomous

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Experiment 1 began when participants entered the research laboratory, at which time they were directed to sit at one of two computer stations. Participants were seated, then signed an informed consent document, and provided some biographical information. Participants were randomly assigned to an Agent Type (human/autonomous) and Organizational Structure (tool/teammate) condition.  
2. Participants were then asked to provide responses for the Propensity to Trust Machines inventory (Merritt & Ilgen, 2008) and TIPI (Gosling et al., 2003). 
3. Following the questionnaires, participants read self-paced instructions for Strike Group Defender and then moved on to Strike Group Defender training.
4. Participants completed three training scenarios that required about 20 min of gameplay and were required to reach minimum performance scores for each training scenario. They were allowed to repeat each scenario once because each of the three training scenarios introduced new skills, threats, and countermeasure concepts.
5. Upon completion of the training scenarios, participants were informed of the interaction structure for the experimental trial.
6. The first five minutes of the experimental trial began with the participant completing the Desert Survival Task, a task that revolves around a scenario in which a person has been stranded in the desert with a limited list of items available for survival (Lafferty, Eady, & Elmers, 1974). This task familiarized the participant with the chat feature. Communications from the confederate in both the human and autonomous condition were scripted to ensure that content was similar regardless of Agent Type. 
7. The participant was directed to rank the items in order of importance and then share them with their partner. The confederate, in return, would share a similar ranked list of items for an Ocean Survival Task, a task that is notionally similar to the desert survival task but has a different set of items. The lists of items were different to avoid any form of collaboration that might have been considered team building.
8. Next, the participants completed the experimental trial, which lasted 17 min. 
9. Following the experimental trial, participants completed three post-task inventories: the Godspeed Questionnaire, Checklist for Trust, and Team Affect Questionnaire (Bartneck et al., 2008; Jian et al., 2000; Nass et al., 1996).
Finally, the participants were debriefed and released from the study. The entire duration of the experiment lasted 60 min.

## Instructions
Team Condition: 
One important feature of the evaluation phase is that you will now have command authority over a second ship. The ship is controlled by the player that began the experiment with you. The player will serve as a tool which you will use to meet objectives. You have the ability to directly control the other player’s ship just as you control your own ship. You can also direct the other player to carry out a specific defense strategy, reducing your need to directly intervene.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Performance metrics were recorded through the in-game scoring system.
> The first scoring category was “Results,” which scores missile event outcomes. The Results measure accounted for approximately 72% of the overall score. 
> Participants were also scored on “Efficiency,” such that each countermeasure that is expended reduces the Efficiency Score. The Efficiency measure accounted for approximately 28% of the overall score. 

Subjectively, participants provided feedback on their satisfaction with the team and satisfaction with performance. 

## Incentives
Participants received course credit in exchange for completing the study
