# Summary
The task investigates the effect of cultural blocks on people's thinking and problem-solving ability. In this experiment, participants work in a group of six to come up with as many ways to get a ping-pong ball out of a steel pipe without damaging the ball, tube, or floor.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
N/A

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Assume that a steel pipe is imbedded in the concrete floor of a bare room. The inside diameter is .06" larger than the diameter of a ping-pong ball(1.50") that is gently at the bottom of the pipe
2. Participants are divided into groups of six people in the room, along with the following objects:
- 100' of clothesline
- A carpenter's hammer
- A chisel
- A box of Wheaties
- A file
- A wire coat hanger
- A monkey wrench
- A light bulb
3. Participant group is asked to list as many ways the group can think of (in five minutes) to get the ball out of the pipe without damaging the ball, tube, or floor.

## Roles 
Each of the six participants had the same role.

## Instructions
Assume that a steel pipe is imbedded in the concrete floor of a bare room shown below. The inside diameter is .06" larger than the diameter of a ping-pong ball(1.50") that is gently at the bottom of the pipe
You are one of six people in the room, along with the following objects:

100' of clothesline
A carpenter's hammer
A chisel
A box of Wheaties
A file
A wire coat hanger
A monkey wrench
A light bulb

List as many ways you can think of (in five minutes) to get the ball out of the pipe without damaging the ball, tube, or floor.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Fluency and flexibility of thoughts.

1. Fluency (quantity of methods): refers to the number of concepts one produces in a given length of time. If you are a fluent thinker, you have a long list of methods of retrieving the ball from the pipe.

2. Flexibility (creativity): refers to the diversity of the ideas generated. If you are a flexible thinker, you should have come up with a wide variety of methods. For example, if a participant group thought of smashing the handle of the hammer with the monkey wrench and using the resulting splinters to retrieve the ball, they were demonstrating a bit more flexibility of thought, since one does not usually think of using a tool as a source of splinters to do something with. 

## Incentives
No incentives are mentioned.
