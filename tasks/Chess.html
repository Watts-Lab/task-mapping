<p>The rules of chess are published by <a name="/wiki/FIDE" title="FIDE">FIDE</a> (<i>Fédération Internationale des Échecs</i>), chess's international governing body, in its <i>Handbook</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a name="#cite_note-6">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2018.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Setup"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.1</span> Setup</span></h3>
<p>By convention, chess <a name="/wiki/Chess_piece" title="Chess piece">game pieces</a> are divided into <a name="/wiki/White_and_Black_in_chess" title="White and Black in chess">white and black</a> sets. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are set out as shown in the <a name="/wiki/Chess_diagram" title="Chess diagram">diagram</a> and photo. The players of the sets are referred to as <i>White</i> and <i>Black</i>, respectively.
</p><p>The game is played on a square <a name="/wiki/Chessboard" title="Chessboard">board</a> of eight rows (called <i><dfn id=""><a name="/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#ranks" title="Glossary of chess"><span title="See entry at: Glossary of chess § ranks" >files</span></a></dfn></i>, denoted <i>a</i> to <i>h</i> from left to right according to White's perspective). The 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as <i>light</i> and <i>dark</i> squares. The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. Thus, each queen starts on a square of its own color (the white queen on a light square; the black queen on a dark square).

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Movement"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.2</span> Movement</span></h3>
<p>In competitive games, the colors are allocated by the organizers; in informal games, the colors are usually decided randomly, for example by coin toss, or by one player's concealing a white and black pawn in either hand and having the opponent choose. White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for <a name="/wiki/Castling" title="Castling">castling</a>, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of <i><a name="/wiki/En_passant" title="En passant">en passant</a></i>, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies.
</p><p>Moving is compulsory; it is illegal to skip a turn, even when having to move is <a name="/wiki/Zugzwang" title="Zugzwang">detrimental</a>. A player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king in <a name="#Check">check</a>. If the player to move has no legal move, the game is over; the result is either <a name="/wiki/Checkmate" title="Checkmate">checkmate</a> (a loss for the player with no legal move) if the king is in check, or <a name="/wiki/Stalemate" title="Stalemate">stalemate</a> (a draw) if the king is not.
</p><p>Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).
</p>
<div>
<div ></div>
<ul><li>The <a name="/wiki/King_(chess)" title="King (chess)">king</a> moves one square in any direction. The king also has a special move called <i><a name="#Castling">castling</a></i> that involves also moving a rook.</li>
<li>A <a name="/wiki/Rook_(chess)" title="Rook (chess)">rook</a> can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</li>
<li>A <a name="/wiki/Bishop_(chess)" title="Bishop (chess)">bishop</a> can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
<li>The <a name="/wiki/Queen_(chess)" title="Queen (chess)">queen</a> combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</li>
<li>A <a name="/wiki/Knight_(chess)" title="Knight (chess)">knight</a> moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</li>
<li>A <a name="/wiki/Pawn_(chess)" title="Pawn (chess)">pawn</a> can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram); or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, by moving to that square (black "x"s). A pawn has two special moves: the <i><a name="#En_passant">en passant</a></i> capture and <a name="#Promotion">promotion</a>.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Castling"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.3</span> Castling</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a name="/wiki/Castling" title="Castling">Castling</a></div>
</p>
<ul><li>Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game.</li>
<li>There are no pieces between the king and the rook.</li>
<li>The king cannot be in <a name="#Check">check</a>, nor can the king pass through any square that is under attack by an enemy piece, or move to a square that would result in check. (Note that castling <i>is</i> permitted if the rook is under attack, or if the rook crosses an attacked square.)</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="En_passant"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.4</span> <i>En passant</i></span></h3>
<p><span id="en_passant"></span>
</p>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a name="/wiki/En_passant" title="En passant">En passant</a></div>
<p>When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponent's pawn can capture it <i>en passant</i> ("in passing"), moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the very next turn; otherwise the right to do so is forfeited. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two steps from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it <i>en passant</i> on g6 (but only on White's next move).
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Promotion"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.5</span> Promotion</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a name="/wiki/Promotion_(chess)" title="Promotion (chess)">Promotion (chess)</a></div>
<p>When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is <i>promoted</i> and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called <a name="/wiki/Underpromotion" class="mw-redirect" title="Underpromotion">underpromotion</a>. In the <a name="#En_passant">animated diagram</a>, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted. There is no restriction on the piece promoted to, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (e.g., two or more queens).
</p>
<div ></div>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Check"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.6</span> Check</span></h3>
<div role="note" class="hatnote navigation-not-searchable">Main article: <a name="/wiki/Check_(chess)" title="Check (chess)">Check (chess)</a></div>
<p>When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be <i>in <a name="/wiki/Check_(chess)" title="Check (chess)">check</a></i>. A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check.
</p><p>The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual games it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, but this is not required by the rules of chess, and is not usually done in tournaments.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="End_of_the_game"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.7</span> End of the game</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Win"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.7.1</span> Win</span></h4>
<p>Games can be won in the following ways:
</p>
<ul><li><i><a name="/wiki/Checkmate" title="Checkmate">Checkmate</a>:</i> The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.</li>
<li><i><a name="/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Resigning" title="Rules of chess">Resignation</a>:</i> Either player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a name="#cite_note-8">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a hopeless position, and for this reason high-level games rarely end in checkmate.</li>
<li><i>Win on time:</i> In games with a <a name="/wiki/Time_control" title="Time control">time control</a>, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.</li>
<li><i>Forfeit:</i> A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament, can be forfeited. In high-level tournaments, players have been forfeited for such things as:
<ul><li>arriving late for the game (even by a matter of seconds);</li>
<li>receiving a call or text on a cell phone;</li>
<li>refusing to undergo a drug test;</li>
<li>refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices;</li>
<li>unsporting behavior (e.g. refusing to shake hands with the opponent).</li></ul></li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Draw"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.7.2</span> Draw</span></h4>
<p>There are several ways games can end in a <a name="/wiki/Draw_(chess)" title="Draw (chess)">draw</a>:
</p>
<ul><li><i><a name="/wiki/Draw_by_agreement" title="Draw by agreement">Draw by agreement</a>:</i> Draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.</li>
<li><i><a name="/wiki/Stalemate" title="Stalemate">Stalemate</a>:</i> The player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check.</li>
<li><i><a name="/wiki/Threefold_repetition" title="Threefold repetition">Threefold repetition</a> of position:</i> This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage. In this situation, either player can claim a draw; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid. FIDE rules make no mention of <a name="/wiki/Perpetual_check" title="Perpetual check">perpetual check</a>; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition.</li>
<li><i><a name="/wiki/Fifty-move_rule" title="Fifty-move rule">Fifty-move rule</a>:</i> If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made, either player can claim a draw. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than 50 moves before a pawn move or capture is made; examples include some endgames with <a name="/wiki/Two_knights_endgame" title="Two knights endgame">two knights against a pawn</a> and some <a name="/wiki/Pawnless_chess_endgame" title="Pawnless chess endgame">pawnless endgames</a> such as queen against two bishops. Historically, FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames, but these have since been repealed. Some <a name="/wiki/Correspondence_chess" title="Correspondence chess">correspondence chess</a> organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a name="#cite_note-10">&#91;note 2&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><i>Fivefold repetition of position:</i> Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn. This is a relatively recent (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.</li>
<li><i>Seventy-five-move rule:</i> Similar to the fifty-move rule, but as with the fivefold repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by the players, and allows a tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.</li>
<li><i><dfn id=""><a name="/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#insufficient_material" title="Glossary of chess"><span title="See entry at: Glossary of chess § Insufficient material" >Insufficient material</span></a></dfn>:</i> If neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent; for example, if a player has only the king and a knight, and the opponent has only the king, checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand, if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply.</li>
<li><i>Draw on time:</i> In games with a <a name="/wiki/Time_control" title="Time control">time control</a>, the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Time_control"><span class="mw-headline-number">1.8</span> Time control</span></h3>
<p>In competition, chess games are played with a <a name="/wiki/Time_control" title="Time control">time control</a>. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided the opponent has <a name="/wiki/Rules_of_chess#Timing" title="Rules of chess">enough pieces left</a> to deliver checkmate). The duration of a game ranges from long (or "classical") games, which can take up to seven hours (even longer if <a name="/wiki/Adjournment_(chess)" class="mw-redirect" title="Adjournment (chess)">adjournments</a> are permitted), to <a name="/wiki/Bullet_chess" class="mw-redirect" title="Bullet chess">bullet chess</a> (under 3&#160;minutes per player for the entire game). Intermediate between these are <a name="/wiki/Rapid_chess" class="mw-redirect" title="Rapid chess">rapid chess</a> games, lasting between 20&#160;minutes and two hours per game, a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments.
</p><p>Time is controlled using a <a name="/wiki/Chess_clock" title="Chess clock">chess clock</a> that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with <a name="/wiki/Time_control#Compensation_(increment_or_delay_methods)" title="Time control">increments</a>.
</p><p>Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competition. A typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves.
