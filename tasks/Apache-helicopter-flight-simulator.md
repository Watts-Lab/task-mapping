# Summary
In Experiment 1, using a a PC-based Apache helicopter flight simulator called Longbow2, participants in groups of 3 were given 15 minutes to complete various tasks (e.g. destroying enemy tanks) and stay alive. In Experiment 2, participants used low-fidelity tank battle simulation called Team Wargame Interaction Simulation Training in groups of 3. Teams were asked to take over enemy pillboxes, pick them up, and relocate them in friendly territory, where they were rebuilt as allied weapons in the simulation.

The paper varied the cross-training of participants.

# Procedure
## Steps

## Experiment 1
1. Participants received 1.5 hr of role-specific task skills training.
2. Three role-specific 15-item position competency tests were administered to participants on an individual basis immediately following training. For each incorrect item, the experimenter spent additional time with participants to ensure that role-based tasks were mastered
3. Participants received cross-training manipulation followed by 3 15 minute practice sessions.
4. Team members then individually responded to manipulation check items and completed concept maps.
5. Team members performed the task in two parallel, counterbalanced 15-min performance episodes.

## Experiment 2
1. Participants received 2 hr of individual skills training on tank driving, weapon systems, and team strategies for movement across the battlefield and capturing enemies. Experimenters used coaching and task checklists to ensure that teams reached a basic level of competency on the simulation before advancing further in the experiment
2. Teams received the cross-training manipulation followed by a 35-min practice session. Teams in the positional rotation condition spent 14 min of this practice period in other members’ roles (7 min per role).
3. Team members then individually responded to manipulation check items and completed concept maps.
4. Teams took part in a 40-min performance period completing the task.


## Roles 
## Experiment 1
Pilot: Flies the aircraft
Gunner: Operates the weapons system
Radar Specialist: Responsible for monitoring and interpreting radar systems containing critical enemy information.

## Experiment 2
Three non-distinct roles: not all team members had the ability to shoot in the tank, and only one team member could build defense systems.

## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

If the instructions are not available ask the paper's authors, however and if that fails, write new ones that appear as suitable as possible.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 
## Experiment 1
Cross-Training Effectiveness: Cross-training effects were evaluated by participant responses to a 15-item multiple-choice scale that measured interpositional knowledge. Questions asked participants about their knowledge of team members’ equipment and task-related responsibilities. Sample items included “When the helicopter is destroying an enemy, what must the pilot do?” and “Who is responsible for identifying targets?” Participants were given 1 point for each correct item. Items were then summed to form a total score ranging from 0 to 15.

Shared Team Interaction Model: Teammates were asked to make judgments about the relatedness of each pair of concepts (i.e. escape enemy attacks, follow waypoints,
identify enemy, position helicopter for targeting) by using a Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not related) to 9 (very related). The data was processed using the Pathfinder computer program to relfect the overlap among each pair of member
similarity matrices on a scale from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap). These three values (one for each pair of teammates) were then averaged
to form the similarity score.

Coordination: The task was recorded, and the audio was analyzed by graduate students for coordinatation and backup behavior. Subject matter experts rated separately the overall frequency (i.e., how much it occurred) and quality (i.e., how well it was executed) of team coordination as well as the overall quantity and quality of team backup behavior by using Likert-type scales ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7 (very good).

Task performance: A score was calculated from the sum of the number of targets acquired during the course of each mission and the team’s minutes of “alive time,” averaged over the two parallel missions. Team performance scores could range from 0 (no targets killed, helicopter killed by enemies immediately) to 30 (killed 15 targets, stayed alive for the duration of the 15-minute mission).

## Experiment 2
Cross-Training Effectiveness: . Cross-training effects were evaluated by participant responses to the following statements: “I understand the responsibilities of my teammates” and “I would feel comfortable switching roles with [my teammate].” Responses were made on a 5-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

Shared Team Interation Model: Participants were asked to choose from 50 concepts important to team interaction and place 12 of them in a prespecified hierarchical structure illustrating the sequence of task-related activities required to accomplish their mission. Examples of concepts included the following: travel in V formation, build barriers, shoot pillbox, and ambush from forest. Overlap in team members’ concept maps was assessed by the percentage of shared concepts placed identically on the concept maps. Higher scores on the mental model measure (ranged from 0% to 100%) indicated that a greater percentage of concepts were shared by all three members of a team.

Coordination: The measure of team coordination used for this study was a computer-logged objective index of tank distance from the other two tanks on the battlefield. Coordination indices were objectively computed every minute over the course of a 40-min performance mission and then averaged. Scores were reversed before statistical analysis so that higher scores would represent less dispersion and thus better coordination.

Team performance: Teams were scored 0 to 15, gaining 1 point or every pillbox they captured and rebuilt.
