# Summary
In this experiment two groups are created, A and B, where one group is the dictators and the other is the receivers.  These groups do not interact, but within the experiment the dictators are told that they are responsible for the monetary payout of their receiver, however the funds come out of their own pocket.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
Many alternate versions of the game exists, with the main variation being the amount of money offered(i.e. the base amount of money given to each participant varies).  Other variations include group sizes(i.e. differing amount of participants and dictators).

Participants (or receivers) can be paid a flat rate, or can be paid for doing extra tasks.

Dana et. Al. Variation:
Private Condition: In this variation, the dictator is told that the amount they decide to allocate for their receiver is just given to them with a note attached stating, “Thank you for your time today. An additional $__ is attached to this note.” The exit option is still available.


John A’s experiment included allocating all participants a baseline of $5, splitting all participants into two groups, A and B(overall split 50-50, i.e. each dictator has one participant, the same as the procedure discussed), and separating these groups into two rooms(our procedure discussed also allows no contact between the groups). The dictators were then given and addition $5 that they could allocate in $0.50 increments (notably this is still increments of 10%, the same as the procedure discussed).  

Specific Variations from the procedure discussed:
In one experiment, dictators could decide to take up to $1 from their respective participant, in another version of his experiment he allowed for dictators to take up to their participants entire allotted amount.  Subjects in group(room) B were told that participants in group A earned $10 for completing a task, but all participants earned money.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Participants are broken into groups A(Dictators) and B(Participants), and are separated, not allowing contact between the two groups, with the overall distribution being 50-50(i.e. each dictator has one receiver).
2. Participants in group A (The dictators) are distributed written instructions about the game, they and their anonymous receiver will play(the instructions refer to both roles as “participants”).  Meanwhile group B is given unrelated tasks to complete.
3. The Dictators are asked to distribute $10 of real money between them and their receiver, in $1 increments(i.e. 10-0, 9-1, 8-2, etc.).  (NOTE: the dictators instructions state that once a decision is made, the experimenter will distribute the same set of rules to the receiver, even if no money is allocated. Thus the receiver has common knowledge.)
4. Once the dictator has made their choice they are informed of the “Exit Option”, where they take $9 and no further instructions are given to the receiver.
5. The dictator makes a decision and is then dismissed.
6. Regardless of the decision all parties are paid an allotted amount, and the game is over.


## Roles 
Dictator, given the moral decision to pay their receiver out of their own pocket.

Receiver, given tasks to perform in idle time

## Instructions
Groups A and B (Dictators and Receivers) are not to interact, only interaction is between participant and experimenter.

Dictators are given specific instructions on the experiment, stating that they are to decide their receivers’ payout, and their receiver will receive the same copy of instructions unless the exit is taken at a lower payout.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
This is a test of morals.
All dictator decisions are recorded(amount allocated to the receiver, and if they choose to exit).  Specifically, tracking the amount of money allocated to the receiver(referred to as the “gift amount”).  This allows the experimenter to track the mean gift amount, as well as the percentage of the dictator group that chooses to gift an amount of money.  The experimenter can also compare the number of dictators that chose to exit, to those that did not, for each gift amount.

## Incentives
Monetary incentive is offered to all participants for completing tasks.
