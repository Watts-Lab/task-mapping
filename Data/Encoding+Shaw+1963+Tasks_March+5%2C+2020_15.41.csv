Commission (FCC) to control television programming. The aim of the
legislation is to improve the educational and moral quality of
material offered on TV, with specific emphasis on eliminating
violence in children's programs, deceitful practices (like rigged
quiz shows) and obscenity. The proposed legislation would permit
the FCC to refuse or revoke licenses, levy fines, and take other
measures against any TV station, network, or producer whose material
did not live up to a standard ethical and moral code. Many groups
are opposing the legislation on the grounds that such censorship
is a restriction of the right of freedom of speech.

the first half with wide spaces between them, writes the second

""Stuart is a dynamic, popular young fellow who, after holding minor offices, managed to get elected to the state senate when only four years out of college. He is married and has one child. During his term of office a bill has been introduced to give everyone over 55 a pension of $150 a month. Though the bill has wide public support and publicity, Stuart knows it would impose very severe taxes on the younger population and possibly bankrupt the state. Thus, he regards it as the most dangerous bill to come up in the last twenty years. A group of lobbyists have called and made it clear that to stand against the bill would cost him his office, and they even named several mediocre individuals they could put in his place. Furthermore, it seems to Stuart that the lobbyists probably can carry out their threat to replace him with someone else, since there is pressure upon all state senators from the party bosses and public opinion is strongly in favor of the bill. They asked for his decision the next day. What should Stuart do? The following are possible solutions: 
A. Work to get all Senators to vote against the bill and do the same. 
B. Start a long range program that would start slowly and advance according to the ability of the state. 
C. Fight by making appeal to young voters. 
D. Make a counter offer changing the age to older and amount of the pension to a lower amount.

A copy of the following
statement for each member of the group:
''A young business executive is faced a rather serious
problem in his personal life. Here is his story:
'I have been married six years and have a son four years old.
My wife and I have always been very much in love with each other,
and we have never had any serious disagreements. My wife is a very
intelligent person, and she still remembers her father's unfaithfulness to her mother and the shame and humiliation which she and
her mother suffered as a result. Consequently, she regards faithfulness as the one indispensable condition for a successful marriage.
I agree that faithfulness is important, but I feel that above all
a husband and wife should always be completely frank with each other
if their relationship is to be a happy one.
About two years ago, we purchased our ''dream house in a
small town in New Jersey. Since that time, I have commuted 75
miles a day to and from my office in New York City. Consequently
I have frequently found it convenient to work late and stay over-'
night in the city, rather than spoil a week-end by going to work
on Saturday. My job is such that I must have secretarial help,
and it was only natural that my regular secretary should work
late with me.
At first, all went along as usual. Then I developed the habit
of going out to dinner after work, and, again, it seemed only natural
that I take my secretary along with me. (After all, she was human
and got hungry, too.) My secretary was a very attractive and
understanding young woman, and ••• well, to make a long story
short, one thing led to another, and soon I was spending as many
evenings with her as possible Of course my secretary knew that
I was married, and that our relationship was superficial and temporary; but she seemed to enjoy my company as much as I did hers.
The whole affair ended more than six months ago when my secretary
resigned to get married.
I have never mentioned this affair to my wife. At first, it
seemed harmless enough; later, it became so involved that I did not 
know how to explain it to her. I tried to bring it up once by talking about my work, but my wife remarked that she was horrified by
some of the stories she had heard about executives becoming involved
with their secretaries. She was sure, she said, that such a
terrible thing could never happen to us. Naturally, I could not
tell her after that~
I feel terribly guilty and feel that if I don't tell her
there will always be a barrier between us which would make our
marriage deceitful, and yet I am afraid that if I do tell her, it
will be a blow to my wife that might break up our marriage.'
What do you think is the wisest thing for him to do, assuming
that for his own peace of mind he can't just forget the matter?"" ",No,"""Your task is to analyze the situation described in the material you have been given, and give the business

This decision has generated considerable controversy, even among persons of strong religious persuasion. Those supporting the decision do so largely on the basis of separation
of church and state, and the constitutional provision of freedom of worship. These persons argue that reading the Bible in schools forces exposure of all sects to essentially protestant teachings. Those opposed to the decision argue that it weakens the moral foundations of the schools and indeed the country. Mere reading of the Bible, they say, does not constitute teaching religious beliefs.""
