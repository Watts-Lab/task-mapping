In this situation, you are asked to work together to solve crypts. Cryptography is the art of secret writing. In it, one word or letter or number is substituted for another, or the words are scrambled in such a fashion that they are unreadable. Here are several examples: (a) The letters
of the alphabet are reversed so that Z stands for A, Y for B,
X for C, and so on. Thus the word class is written xozhh.
(b) The letters are written in couplets; then one writes out the
first of each pair, then the second. For example, pencil would be
pniecl. To break this code, one simply divides the letters in
half, writes the first half with wide spaces between them, writes
the second half below with letters corresponding to spaces above, and combines the two. (c) Another method takes the first, then the second, then the third, and so on, letters of each word. E.g., Are you here becomes ayhroeeure. (d) A final procedure is called the Horizontal or Vertical Route Transposition Code. First, the message is written in a series of horizontal columns; ' then select the letters in come mixed up manner. E.g., This is really very easy might be done in this manner:

James. (i) In each case the coat, where the bullet entered, was
blackened with gunpowder, and the cloth a little singed. (j) Captain Watts was devoted to his son and would have died sooner than
harm him purposely; hence it is impossible to suppose that he

clear that to stand against the bill would cost him his office, and they even named several mediocre individuals they could put in his place.

Commission (FCC) to control television programming. The aim of the
legislation is to improve the educational and moral quality of
material offered on TV, with specific emphasis on eliminating
violence in children's programs, deceitful practices (like rigged
quiz shows) and obscenity. The proposed legislation would permit
the FCC to refuse or revoke licenses, levy fines, and take other
measures against any TV station, network, or producer whose material
did not live up to a standard ethical and moral code. Many groups
are opposing the legislation on the grounds that such censorship is a restriction of the right of freedom of speech.

his term of office a bill has been introduced to give everyone
over 55 a pension of $150 a month. Though the bill has wide public support and publicity, Stuart knows it would impose very severe
taxes on the younger population and possibly bankrupt the state.
Thus, he regards it as the most dangerous bill to come up in the
last twenty years. A group of lobbyists have called and made it
clear that to stand against the bill would cost him his office, and
they even named several mediocre individuals they could put in his
place. Furthermore, it seems to Stuart that the lobbyists probably
can carry out their threat to replace him with someone else, since
there is pressure upon all state senators from the party bosses
and public opinion is strongly in favor of the bill. They asked
for his decision the next day. What should Stuart do? The following
are possible solutions:
A. Work to get all Senators to vote against the bill and
do the same.
B. Start a long range program that would start slowly
and advance according to the ability of the state.
C. Fight by making appeal to young voters.
D. Make a counter offer changing the age to older and
amount of the pension to a lower amount.
E. Talk to the public over the radio and get the public
to see that the bill is a bad one. ","This is a group task. Discuss the case you

would probably be suspended from the school, or at least given an

unpopular with the students during the rest of his stay. He can
afford to go nowhere else.

of the others would be sufficient in such a small class to cause
him to fail. What should he do?""

''A young business executive is faced with a rather serious problem in his personal life. Here is his story:
'I have been married six years and have a son four years old. My wife and I have always been very much in love with each other, and we have never had any serious disagreements. My wife is a very intelligent person, and she still remembers her father's unfaithfulness to her mother and the shame and humiliation which she and her mother suffered as a result. Consequently, she regards faithfulness as the one indispensable condition for a successful marriage.
I agree that faithfulness is important, but I feel that above all a husband and wife should always be completely frank with each other if their relationship is to be a happy one.
About two years ago, we purchased our ''dream house"" in a small town in New Jersey. Since that time, I have commuted 75 miles a day to and from my office in New York City. Consequently I have frequently found it convenient to work late and stay overnight in the city, rather than spoil a week-end by going to work on Saturday. My job is such that I must have secretarial help, and it was only natural that my regular secretary should work late with me.
At first, all went along as usual. Then I developed the habit of going out to dinner after work, and, again, it seemed only natural that I take my secretary along with me. (After all, she was human and got hungry, too.) My secretary was a very attractive and understanding young woman, and . . . well, to make a long story
short, one thing led to another, and soon I was spending as many evenings with her as possible. Of course my secretary knew that I was married, and that our relationship was superficial and temporary; but she seemed to enjoy my company as much as I did hers. The whole affair ended more than six months ago when my secretary resigned to get married.
I have never mentioned this affair to my wife. At first, it seemed harmless enough; later, it became so involved that I did not know how to explain it to her. I tried to bring it up once by talking about my work, but my wife remarked that she was horrified by some of the stories she had heard about executives becoming involved with their secretaries. She was sure, she said, that such a terrible thing could never happen to us. Naturally, I could not tell her after that.
I feel terribly guilty and feel that if I don't tell her there will always be a barrier between us which would make our marriage deceitful, and yet I am afraid that if I do tell her, it will be a blow to my wife that might break up our marriage.'

In order to insure the safety of the submarine and because of the danger of being spotted on the coast, the crew delayed its dash to the coast as long as they dared to. As the crew headed to the pick-up point, they became aware that enemy troups were on their trail. The crew had reason to believe that the pursuers were less than a day's distance behind.

clear that to stand against the bill would cost him his office, and

statement for each member of the group:
''A young business executive is faced a rather serious
problem in his personal life. Here is his story:
'I have been married six years and have a son four years old.
My wife and I have always been very much in love with each other,
and we have never had any serious disagreements. My wife is a very
intelligent person, and she still remembers her father's unfaithfulness to her mother and the shame and humiliation which she and
her mother suffered as a result. Consequently, she regards faithfulness as the one indispensable condition for a successful marriage.
I agree that faithfulness is important, but I feel that above all
a husband and wife should always be completely frank with each other
if their relationship is to be a happy one.
About two years ago, we purchased our ''dream house in a
small town in New Jersey. Since that time, I have commuted 75
miles a day to and from my office in New York City. Consequently
I have frequently found it convenient to work late and stay over-'
night in the city, rather than spoil a week-end by going to work
on Saturday. My job is such that I must have secretarial help,
and it was only natural that my regular secretary should work
late with me.
At first, all went along as usual. Then I developed the habit
of going out to dinner after work, and, again, it seemed only natural
that I take my secretary along with me. (After all, she was human
and got hungry, too.) My secretary was a very attractive and
understanding young woman, and ••• well, to make a long story
short, one thing led to another, and soon I was spending as many
evenings with her as possible Of course my secretary knew that
I was married, and that our relationship was superficial and temporary; but she seemed to enjoy my company as much as I did hers.
The whole affair ended more than six months ago when my secretary
resigned to get married.
I have never mentioned this affair to my wife. At first, it
seemed harmless enough; later, it became so involved that I did not 
know how to explain it to her. I tried to bring it up once by talking about my work, but my wife remarked that she was horrified by
some of the stories she had heard about executives becoming involved
with their secretaries. She was sure, she said, that such a
terrible thing could never happen to us. Naturally, I could not
tell her after that~
I feel terribly guilty and feel that if I don't tell her
there will always be a barrier between us which would make our
marriage deceitful, and yet I am afraid that if I do tell her, it
will be a blow to my wife that might break up our marriage.'
What do you think is the wisest thing for him to do, assuming
that for his own peace of mind he can't just forget the matter?"" ","""Your task is to analyze the situation described in the material you have been given, and give the business

","(The diagram shown above, left, is shown to the group.) ""This is a kind of search task. On each trial, you will choose one of the coordinates on this chart, e.g., D-5, E-10, etc. For each problem, I will have a chart with concentric, irre-gular lines drawn on it, like this (a diagram similar to the one shown above, right, is displayed to the group). The value of your decision will be determined by the value on this diagram. For example, if you choose D-3, this coordinate is outside the largest circle and has a value of zero; if you choose a coordinate between the largest and next largest circle, you get a value of 5, etc. The object is to earn as high n score as possible on the 10 trials allowed on each problem. After each decision, I will tell you the score you have earned according to my diagram. At first, of course, you will have no basis for making a choice. However, after a few trials, you should begin to learn something about the diagram that I have, and thus be able to make more intelligent decisions. The decision must be a group decision. You will be allowed three minutes for discussion in making each decision. If you wish you may choose the same coordinate on successive trials.
