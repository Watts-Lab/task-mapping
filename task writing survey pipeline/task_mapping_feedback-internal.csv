Joshua,16,Q10maximizing_feedbk,"The nature of the task isn't the case, but the final criteria can be perceived as such",Shopping plan
Linnea,22,Q10maximizing_feedbk,Goal directive does not specify - it could be get as many points as possible,Room assignment task
Mark,22,Q10maximizing_feedbk,Again depends a bit how the incentives work on the specific implementation and instance.,Room assignment task
Emily,16,Q11optimizing_feedbk,I guess the specified standard is your list --- you have to follow the constraints,Shopping plan
Linnea,22,Q11optimizing_feedbk,Goal directive does not specify - it could be to only find the optimal exact solution or 100 points,Room assignment task
Abdullah,8,Q11optimizing_feedbk,"I found the later parts of the elaboration ""Job assignments that make success a function of how closely the individual or group approximates a predetermined 'best' or correct outcome may be called optimizing tasks. For example, the goal may be to generate exactly 10 ideas -- no more or no less, or to exactly reproduce something (such as a task where people have to exactly copy a work of art)"" to be more useful than the earlier parts, so consider switching them.",Word completion given starting letter
Abdullah,15,Q11optimizing_feedbk,"I found this difficult to answer. Satisfying constraints is ""achieving a specified goal""?",Graph coloring task
Abdullah,16,Q11optimizing_feedbk,"""The goal is not to **exclusively** maximize"" as you can have tasks that are both. Also, see my comment about partial credit.",Shopping plan
Abdullah,22,Q11optimizing_feedbk,that's why it is a constraint satisfaction and optimization problem.,Room assignment task
Joshua,22,Q13out_mult_feedbk,In the game where all information and rules are disclosed,Room assignment task
Jessie,8,Q13out_mult_feedbk,"The instructions on the previous page should be divided into several paragraphs, making it easier to read.",Word completion given starting letter
Linnea,8,Q13out_mult_feedbk,Well maybe - for any letter pair there is a finite number of words to come up with. So that would be best,Word completion given starting letter
Linnea,16,Q13out_mult_feedbk,Stimulus complex does not specify if ties are possible,Shopping plan

Emma,22,Q13out_mult_feedbk,I am not sure if there are multiple scenarios/assignments that satisfies all constraints and optimizes utility,Room assignment task
Mark,8,Q13out_mult_feedbk,"Assuming a common dictionary

It might be worth this being an aspect of the specification, i.e., what counts as a word?",Word completion given starting letter
Mark,16,Q13out_mult_feedbk,It depends on the instance,Shopping plan
Abdullah,8,Q13out_mult_feedbk,"I found myself re-reading the questions a couple of times to make sure that I can select the right. I think it will be helpful to make the answers more elaborate: e.g., “No, this task does not have only one “best solution”, “Yes, this task has only one best solution”",Word completion given starting letter
Joshua,15,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,depending on the network,Graph coloring task
Joshua,22,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,could have been also a yes depending on the possible permutation,Room assignment task
Jessie,22,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,"Does the words ""a specified course of action"" mean the description of the task has to clearly state the steps of doing the task/solving the problem?",Room assignment task
Emma,16,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,"I thought the use of ""Answer YES"" and ""Answer NO"" bullet points were helpful. It may be useful to include this format in other questions.",Shopping plan
Mark,15,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,The examples are great here.,Graph coloring task
Abdullah,8,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,"Why are we talking about ""groups"" here? In the room assignment, it could be ""resolve constraints first"" and then ""optimize students"" or vice versa, or a combination of resolving constraints while optimizing. In the world completion, it could be starting with short words and then longer ones or the other way around, etc. Individuals and groups can do all tasks, so the questions should work for both cases...",Word completion given starting letter
Abdullah,15,Q14sol_s_mult_fdbk,"Again, why are we talking about ""Teams"".. what about if an individual is doing the task? they could color all of the nodes in the sequential matter.. start from a random coloring and then fix conflict. They can fix conflict as they go, etc. ..",Graph coloring task
Joshua,15,Q15d_verif_feedbk,given all information and rules are given,Graph coloring task
Joshua,22,Q15d_verif_feedbk,only if all possible solutions are shown,Room assignment task
Emily,16,Q16shared_kno_feedbk,"Sort of: problems like the shopping plan can be FORMULATED as a formal model, but not everyone will actually do it that way (probably very few people will, in fact). Therefore, it's not clear whether the answer to this should be ""yes"" or ""no.""",Shopping plan

Joshua,22,Q17within_sys_feedbk,utility and rules must be given,Room assignment task
Linnea,15,Q17within_sys_feedbk,This depends on whether it is solvable. There may be fewer colors than possible to meet all the conditions.,Graph coloring task
Mark,15,Q17within_sys_feedbk,This is a little tricky because it's possible to specify this problem as a trick question depending on the properties of the network and the number of colors provided. I'm assuming that is not the case.,Graph coloring task
Mark,22,Q17within_sys_feedbk,Depends on the instance.,Room assignment task
Joshua,15,Q18ans_recog_feedbk,but there could be more than one correct answer,Graph coloring task
Joshua,16,Q18ans_recog_feedbk,"it's only a yes, if all possible answers and corresponding payoffs are laid out",Shopping plan

Joshua,22,Q19time_solv_feedbk,because time is limited,Room assignment task
Mark,15,Q19time_solv_feedbk,"Again, the task description leaves it a little hazy about if there are potential trick aspects to this question. i.e., a graph that makes it impossible to answer with any number of colors.",Graph coloring task
Mark,22,Q19time_solv_feedbk,"Some instances may not be solvable, depending on the specifics of the incentive calculation",Room assignment task
Mark,15,Q1concept_beh_feedbk,"This is tricky, do we consider using a mouse as mental or physical effort? If we are measuring amount of effort exerted, then of course bricks are much harder than moving a mouse, but if we are considering the abstract nature of the tasks, moving one kind of item to a simple destination, or moving another kind of item to a destination that is chosen on the fly, one could imagine that it is less clear.",Graph coloring task
Mark,16,Q1concept_beh_feedbk,Might be worth explaining what a UX for 'go to store' might mean here. That certainly sounds very physical.,Shopping plan
Mark,22,Q1concept_beh_feedbk,"Again, this task has a precise motor aspect, which is small in scale but required, and requires dexterity.",Room assignment task

Joshua,22,Q21int_jud_feedbk,when all utility and rules data are given,Room assignment task
Abdullah,16,Q21int_jud_feedbk,"Because the ""quality"" dimension might be subjective. But price and distance are objective.",Shopping plan
Joshua,22,Q22con_trade_feedbk,"because there's only a single criterion, utility",Room assignment task
Linnea,15,Q22con_trade_feedbk,Trade off in that if you pick color A for one node you can’t pick it for another — you have trade offs in your approach,Graph coloring task
Mark,15,Q22con_trade_feedbk,"This is subtle, there are causal dependencies of decisions, which means that each decision is made on the basis of prior decisions made by oneself or others. e.g., changing color might break existing things, is that worth it? 

That said, these don't look like traditional trade offs or like the example, so I could imagine arguing the other direction too.",Graph coloring task

Emma,8,Q23ss_outc_u_feedbk,"I can understand that there is uncertainty in not knowing if one remembered/wrote down all of the possible words, but they can be certain about the words they did write down. I had some trouble applying this question to the task because of this.",Word completion given starting letter
Mark,15,Q23ss_outc_u_feedbk,This depends a lot on the UI and level of the task. Since its not entirely clear what they see its hard to know if they would have awareness of this type.,Graph coloring task
Abdullah,22,Q23ss_outc_u_feedbk,hmm this one depends on whether we tell them that they found the optimal solution or not. This should be part of the stimulus complex.,Room assignment task
Jessie,16,Q24eureka_q_fdbk,"If the task does not need a ""trick"" at all, how should we answer this question?",Shopping plan

Mark,15,Q2intel_manip_fdbk,"Its hard to know where things lie on this ratio. For example, where is moving bricks? Its certainly not 1, but is it .6 or .9 or something else? 

I guess it might be valuable to have examples for low, mid (~ .5) and high.",Graph coloring task
Mark,22,Q2intel_manip_fdbk,"Compared with other scale questions, this one is less interpretable. Others have something like ""1 is ... and 0 is ..."" as well as more examples at each end. I think it's worth adding that in here too.",Room assignment task
Abdullah,8,Q2intel_manip_fdbk,"lol - it took me a minute to figure out that the line was for the slider, as opposed to an option for horizontal scroll.  I think this question can be simplified for the Turkers by explicitly saying that moving the brick from A to B should be 1 and calculating the top is a 0.",Word completion given starting letter
Mark,15,Q3type_1_feedback,"I think a lot of people wouldn't think ""planning task"" exclusively means ""a task in which a plan is explicitly constructed and recorded"". If I plan a meal, but instead of writing things down I just start cooking, did I do a planning task, or just a cooking task, or something else?

I know this is part of the definition as constructed, but it almost feels misleading to refer to it in this way.",Graph coloring task
Mark,22,Q3type_1_feedback,"Again, this is a strange question. Are we creating a plan as in a proposal of where to put students? I think a literal interpretation of the question would suggest yes. But it could be read another way too.",Room assignment task
Mark,15,Q5creativity_feedbck,"The examples here are useful, I still wonder if adding any points on the range would help?",Graph coloring task
Abdullah,8,Q5creativity_feedbck,"I changed my mind about the ""no default value"" for the slider. Maybe we try 0.5 and it is fine if it anchors people (so they won't go to the extremes of 0 and 1 (as long as the anchoring bias is balanced across the two classes). Also, I would suggest in the elaboration to use the examples from the previous question and giving them values here.",Word completion given starting letter
Jessie,22,Q6type_5_feedback,"I am not sure whether maximizing utility of the students could conflict with the constraining conditions. If it could, then people could have have differences in opinions.",Room assignment task
Emma,16,Q6type_5_feedback,"In explaining the question (for example, the geological survey team), it might be good to emphasize that this resolution of different points of view can be for a collective goal (in the geological survey example, that collective goal would be to make recommendations as a group). I think it might make the ask clearer if explained as a step toward a collective goal/action.",Shopping plan
Mark,15,Q6type_5_feedback,"This is a little tricky based only on the limited description but I think people will understand it as participants having somewhat independent viewpoints depending on the level of the task. If that feels like the wrong intuition, I think we need to adjust the task description to reinforce the goals.",Graph coloring task
Mark,22,Q6type_5_feedback,"Might be clearer to say ""resolve participant's differences of opinion"" because the task is to resolve people's differences of opinion, just not the participants'.",Room assignment task
Abdullah,22,Q6type_5_feedback,"Is there a way to make this question work for ""individuals"" as opposed to only the ""group"" version?",Room assignment task
Joshua,8,Q7type_7_feedback,Unless arranged otherwise,Word completion given starting letter
Abdullah,8,Q7type_7_feedback,"this one seems a bit tricky. Because it could be a win/lose against the researchers who will have to pay the players based on their performance (e.g., the more correct words the player generates, the more the ""game designer"" will have to pay as bonuses). Should we add to the elaboration to exclude this possible interpretation?",Word completion given starting letter
Joshua,16,Q8type_8_feedback,Standard = highest score for all parameters,Shopping plan
Jessie,22,Q8type_8_feedback,It's unclear whether there is a minimum threshold of total utility needed for participants to pass/be successful in the task,Room assignment task
Linnea,22,Q8type_8_feedback,Unspecified in goal directives — do you only win if you get the optimal solution? Or are you just maximizing points?,Room assignment task
Emma,16,Q8type_8_feedback,It may be useful to give an example of the other option of task type (the more precise task) rather than 3 examples of only the all-or-nothing task type.,Shopping plan
Mark,22,Q8type_8_feedback,"This is unclear given the limited description, for example, if I don't assign everyone, do I get a score of 0 or do I get a score of the people who I was able to assign? 

So, I think the answer is consistently no, but I'm more generally uncertain if theres a base level threshold, then should this be yes?",Room assignment task
Abdullah,16,Q8type_8_feedback,"I am assuming you can get partial credit. I think this will need to be added to the ""goal directives"".. For example, ""The goal is to purchase as many high-quality items as possible in a fixed amount of time, and to get the highest number of points by considering tradeoffs between price, quality, and driving time... ***getting anything less than the maximum number of points will lead to partial credit*** or ***getting anything less than the maximum number of points will lead to no credit***"" We have to pick one!!",Shopping plan
Abdullah,22,Q8type_8_feedback,"because you get partial credit for solutions that satisfy the constraints, even if not optimally optimizes the utility.",Room assignment task
Abdullah,16,Q9div_unitary_feedbk,"I think this is really about the interdependence between task components as opposed to how people break them down (e.g., the group process).",Shopping plan
