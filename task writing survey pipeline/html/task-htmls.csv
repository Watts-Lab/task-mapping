Word completion given starting letter,"<h2>Word completion given starting letter</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given a starting letter and ending letter for words. For example, the start letter could be &ldquo;S&rdquo; and the end letter could be &ldquo;N.&rdquo; The starting and ending letters are selected such that there is always a nonzero set of English words that can be created.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to generate a list of valid English words using the starting and ending letter provided. Using the previous example, participants could be asked to generate words like &ldquo;SPIN,&rdquo; which starts with &ldquo;S&rdquo; and ends with &ldquo;N.&rdquo; Participants must generate the maximum number of valid words they can within a fixed amount of time. Nonvalid words will be rejected by the system.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/8ea9342a87412579fa804f337d0f75b1ba2902d7,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e1a6b3b6f4cce488d9181d1715cf36327dbe070a
Graph coloring task,"<h2>Graph coloring task</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given one or more &ldquo;graph coloring problems&rdquo;. These are pictures of different topology/network graphs. </p><p>For context, these look like many different nodes (points), which are connected by various edges. Imagine, for example, a picture of a social network: each person in the network is a &ldquo;node,&rdquo; and each of their friends is an &ldquo;edge.&rdquo;</p><p>In this case, all participants have access to and can interact with a shared graph. Participants will also be given a limited set of colors, with a larger number of colors than the minimum required to complete the task successfully.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to use the colors given to &ldquo;color&rdquo; the entire network without conflicts. This means that participants need to assign each node in the graph a color, ensuring that no two connected nodes share the same color. Using our social network example, if Person A and Person B are friends (which means they are connected), they cannot be assigned the same color. Participants must successfully color all nodes and resolve all conflicts within a specified amount of time, or receive no credit.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/8668e1f05c81b8f8e0f44381e897442bed258d23,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e1a6b3b6f4cce488d9181d1715cf36327dbe070a
Shopping plan,"<h2>Shopping plan</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Each participant has a grocery list and a map that shows distances and times between each grocery store, as well as a list of potential items to purchase and how many points they are worth.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>Participants have to plan a shopping trip as though they were all residents of the same house sharing the same car. The goal is to purchase as many high-quality items as possible in a fixed amount of time, and to get the highest number of points by considering tradeoffs between price, quality, and driving time. Participants gain points for every item that they are able to purchase.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/5666cab3f815b5ccc1f61063732bcd784542507a,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e1a6b3b6f4cce488d9181d1715cf36327dbe070a
Room assignment task,"<h2>Room assignment task</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given a set of people (students), rooms, and rules (constraining conditions).</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to assign students to rooms within a fixed amount of time in order to maximize the students&#39; utility as much as possible while also respecting all of the constraining conditions (for example, one rule might say that certain people are not allowed to be in the same room). Students get a specified amount of utility from being assigned to a particular room, which translates to points in the game.</p><p>Participants will be shown the running total of how many points their current submission has earned, but they will not be notified if they have achieved the optimal arrangement. If participants&#39; submission violates some of the contraining conditions, they will receive a score penalty.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/3e61278b26c027d84e87f85b3e8305d33c47ed1c,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e1a6b3b6f4cce488d9181d1715cf36327dbe070a
