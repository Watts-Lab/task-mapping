Euclidean traveling salesperson,"<h2>Euclidean traveling salesperson</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different “paths” by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a “path” between A and B.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to find and select a sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a “traveling salesman” who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant’s goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/d45822be2e3d5334816c4bcbf1e8e7f9c0431c3f,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ff3dcab95faaba1085e706c8bd9a174122d41925
