# Summary
> This study looked at the influence of structural properties on naturally occurring networks given their influence on behavior and dynamics. Through the use of network coloring problems subjects differentiated their color from neighbors and those generated by preferential attachment made solving the coloring problem more difficult than did networks based on cyclical structures, and "small worlds" networks were easier still. This indicates providing more information can have opposite effects on performance, depending on network structure.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Subjects were given a series of coloring experiments based on the six topologies in the figure included above on computers 
> Three of the six networks begin with a simply cycle and add a varying number or random chords while preserving two chromatic chords to represent “small worlds” networks. 
> The fourth cycle is a more engineered and has a hierarchical structure, with two distinguished individuals having inordinately high connectivity. 
> The fifth and sixth networks were developed based on the preferential attachment model in which vertices are highly connected and  tend to generate structural properties like “hubs”. 

> Subjects sat at work stations and worked on a computer that showed a local view (subjects and their neighbors colors) of the current state
> Subjects were familiarized with the coloring problem but were not given any instructions on how to play it 
> Subjects could update their colors at any time from a menu that included the fixed minimum of colors needed to solve the problem and were given different neighbor views from low view (solely subject colors and their neighbors colors), medium view (neighbors colors and labeled and number of links are visible) and high information view (entire network colors visible)

## Roles 
> N/A

## Instructions
> Subjects were familiarized with the coloring problem but were not given any instructions on how to play it 
> No communication was allowed outside the confines of the system and physical partitions were used to prevent subjects from seeing outside workstation 
> The text at the bottom of each network screenshot (second image above)reads as follows: "1 conflict in your immediate neighborhood. A thick line indicates a conflict that must be resolved. A thin line is shown when color choices do not conflict.” The bar at the bottom of each screen gave subjects an indication of global progress toward a solution.


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> Researchers reviewed, the number of colors required for solution, mean completion time of solved networks for each network, the statistics on the distribution of the degree (number of links) of each vertex and the average distance (number of links), network average distance (average shortest path distance measured in number of links traveled over all vertices),  the fraction of trials on which it was solved for each dimension and the number of steps (measured in color changes) for a natural distributed computer heuristic.
 

## Incentives
> One session of experiments used collective or global incentives, in which all 38 participants were each paid S5 for every experiment that resulted in a proper coloring  within the 5 min allotted. 
> The other session used  individual or local incentives, in which a participant received S5 if an experiment ended (due either to proper coloring or the termination of 5 min) with their own color being different from all their network neighbors. There were no noteworthy differences between the two incentive schemes in any of the measures discussed
