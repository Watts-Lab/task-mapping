# Stimuli
## The visual components
> Players used a “rod” to reach for targets (green and yellow) that were briefly shown among distracters (red, magenta, blue, and purple) on a large touch screen
> Green: Player gained a point
> Yellow: Opponent lost a point
> Red: Player lost a point
> Magenta: Opponent gained a point
> Blue: Added to both players
> Purple: Removed from both players

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> Players played 30 different variations of the game.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Participants were paired to stand on either side of a large screen each holding a rod
> They were instructed to hit the green and yellow targets on the screen as they appeared. They would accumulate points for each correct target they hit.
> Participants played 30 Whac-A-Mole games that each lasted 40 seconds. They were allowed to take breaks between rounds

## Roles 
> Each participant had the same role.

## Instructions
> Players were instructed to hold the chopstick like a pen and not to talk during the games. 
> They were instructed neither to block their opponent nor to place the stick on the table and slide from target to target without lifting the stick

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> An open cirlce was used to represent the location of the rod on the screen, and the closed circles represented the targets. When the open circle overlapped a closed circle there was immediate feedback shown by either a green square or red square if the participant won or lost a point respectively.

## Incentives
> Players received a reward of 80 cents when they had won a game, 40 cents for a draw, and no extra reward if lost.
