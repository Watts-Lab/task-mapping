# Summary
In this experiment each subject is given a card on which there appears a set of five (out of six possible) symbols. Each subject's card is different from all the others in that the symbol lacking is a different symbol in each case. Thus, in any set of five cards there is only one symbol in common. The task is for every subject to find the common symbol.

# Procedure
## Steps

1. One hundred male undergraduates of M.I.T.,8 drawn from various classes at the Institute, served as subjects for these experiments.
2. These 100 are split up into 20 groups of five men each. These 20 groups are then further subdivided so that five groups could be tested on each of four experimental patterns.
3. In case the color or geographical position of one's work-space might affect one's behavior, positions are shifted for each new group.
4. Each group is given 15 consecutive trials on one pattern, a process which required one session of about fifty minutes. These subjects are not used again. The order in which the patterns are used is randomized.
  - Each subject is given a card on which there appear a set of five (out of six possible) symbols. Each subject's card is different from all the others in that the symbol lacking, the sixth one, is a different symbol in each case. Thus, in any set of five cards there is only one symbol in common.
  - The problem is for every member to find the common symbol. To accomplish this, each member is allowed to communicate, by means of written messages, with those other members of the group to whom he has an open channel.
  - A subject who has discovered the answer is allowed to pass the answer along.
5. After a group has completed its 15 trials, and before members are permitted to talk with one another, each member is asked to fill out a questionnaire.

## Roles 

Participants were broken into groups of 5 and asked to find the common symbol on their cards.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

- Times (Time Required for Solution):
  Group time (seconds) spent for a correct trial.

- Messages (Number of Communications):
  A count of the number of messages sent by each group during a given (correct) trial. Every separate written communication from one 5 (A) to another (B) is considered one message.

- Errors (Number of incorrect switch):
  An error was defined as the throwing of any incorrect switch by a subject during a trial. Errors that were not corrected before the end of a trial are labelled "final errors"; the others are referred to as "corrected errors."
