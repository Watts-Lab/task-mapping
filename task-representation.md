## Purpose
This document lists the items required in a task description for the task mapping and implementation aspect of the larger project.

The goal is to make a consise set of items that will be completable and will afford both developers and other readers to consistantly interpret all aspects of the task.

The items and overall structure draw on those specified by Laweson and Shaw.

## Items

### 1. stimulus
- The visual components via screenshots
  > Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.
- Materials for alternative versions of the experiment (e.g. the set of eyes in RME)
  > If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli, if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  
  > In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g. in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

### 2.  procedure
- A task flow describing the stages a participant goes through and a formal specification of any conditional or complex relationships therein
  > List the steps that make up the task. This could include a training protocole, pre and post surveys, task rounds etc.
  > Describe the relationship between the steps. By default they are assumed to be cronological and have no interdependencies, but if they are not cronological, e.g. some choice changes the order of the steps, that should be described in full detail. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent in some way, e.g. performance on one step infleunces what is seen on another step, this should also be described in full detail.
- Actual and complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task
  > Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. In the case were instructions have step interdependence, describe that in full detail.

### 3. criteria
- A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specfici materails and the teams actions in a given trial
  > Write out how performance is calculated for this task. In some cases there may be more than one performacne metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. Some of these could be simple metrics, e.g. compeltion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an eqation, a key (e.g. RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.
