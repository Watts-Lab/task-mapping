# Summary
In the task, groups of four were to decide which of 144 sections of land, represented by a 12 by 12 matric on a 80-cm by 80-cm board, were suitable for drilling oil. When the team decided that a particular spot was suitable, a member pulled on of the tabs which appeared on every one of th 144 sections. If the team decided correctly, a red dot appeared on the reverse side oft he tab; otherwise, the tab was blank. There were 33 red dots altogether.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
1. Subects came to the laboratory and were introduced to each other by name 
2. The experimenter explained that the purpose of the experiment was to understand how people make decisions in groups.
3. The subjects completed a translated version of Fiedler's (1967) LPC.
4. The experimenter informed the groups that they simulated an interdiciplinary team of scientists in a consulting firm whose task it was to choose areas of land in which there was a high probability of discovering oil.
5. Subjects were to decide which of the 144 desctions of land were suitable for drilling oit. WHen the team decided on a spot, a member pulled one of the tabs to see if there was a red dot or if the tab was blank.
6.  The subjects were paid according to the number of accurate recommendations they made, and for each mistake they would lose moey (points)


## Roles 
A description of roles if relevant to the task.  

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  

Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  

This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 

## Incentives
A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   

Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
