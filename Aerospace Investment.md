# Summary
This is a two-person scored negotiation simulation involving a venture capital investment. Individuals are scored on their ability to attain favorable investment terms for themselves and on the quality of the relationship they develop with their potential business partner. The simulation introduces the incorporation of process and relationship interests into negotiation strategy. Relationship-straining conflict has been purposefully included in the negotiation to assess studentsâ€™ ability to deal with difficult demands while maintaining a positive relationship.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
A task flow describing the stages a participant goes through and a formal specification of any conditional or complex relationships therein. 

List the steps that make up the task. This could include a training protocol, pre and post surveys, task rounds, etc.  

Describe the relationship between the steps. By default they are assumed to be chronological and have no interdependencies, but if they are not chronological, e.g., a choice changes the order of the steps, that should be described in full detail. Similarly, if the steps are interdependent, e.g., performance on one step influences what is seen on another step, this should be described in full detail.

## Roles 
One particpant playes the role of a venture capatilist investor.

The other is the founder of the aerospace company.
## Instructions
The task has 3 sets of instructions: 1 set of general instructions for both parties, 1 for the VC investor and 1 for the founder.

### General instructions for both parties

In this role simulation, you will negotioate the terms of a potential $100 million investment by venture capital firm _Aerovent Capital_ in the startup company _Earth Escape._ This will be a _balance concerns_ negotiation. As defined by G. Richard Shell in _Bargaining for Advantage,_ a negotation involves balanced concerns if the immediate substantive stakes and future relationship are in balanced tension with each other. Accordingly, each of you will be scored both on your ability to negotiate favorable contract terms for yourself and on the quality of the relationship you develop with your potential business partner.

****Substantive Points****

Each of you will be given confidential instructions explaining your interests and preferences regarding the substantive terms of the investment and their corresponding point values. Point values for each term are unique to your role and are based on your role's personal, professional, and financial concerns. Do not share this information until the entire excercise, including evaluations, has been completed.

****Process Points****

In addition to your substantive points, each of you also will recieve process points, based on your counterpart's perception of your ability to develop and maintain a positive relationship. After you have concluded the substantive negotation, but before you debrief the excercise, each of you will complete a brief process evaluation in which you assess the degree to which your counterpart met five basic process/relationship interests (such as trust) discussed in the confidential instructions, and in which you award process points accordingly.

****Total Score****

Your total score (Substantive Points + Process Points) reflects your overall success in the negotiation. Your goal is to maximize your personal Total Score. YUniversity our Total Score relects the importance of balancing both substantive and relationship concerns, but if your potential business partner has no desire to work with you again, you have left significant value at the negotiating, and this will be reflected in a lower Total Score.

### Confidential instructions for the Founder

# Criteria
