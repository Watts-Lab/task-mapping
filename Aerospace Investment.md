# Summary
This is a two-person scored negotiation simulation involving a venture capital investment. Individuals are scored on their ability to attain favorable investment terms for themselves and on the quality of the relationship they develop with their potential business partner. The simulation introduces the incorporation of process and relationship interests into negotiation strategy. Relationship-straining conflict has been purposefully included in the negotiation to assess studentsâ€™ ability to deal with difficult demands while maintaining a positive relationship.

# Procedure
## Steps

2. Participants negotiate the terms of the 8 scored metrics
3. They then score their partner on the 5 relational dimensions
4. Points are tallied
5. Participants are debriefed on learning objectives and outcomes

## Roles 
One particpant playes the role of a venture capatilist investor.

The other is the founder of the aerospace company.
## Instructions
The task has 3 sets of instructions: 1 set of general instructions for both parties, 1 for the VC investor and 1 for the founder.

### General instructions for both parties

In this role simulation, you will negotioate the terms of a potential $100 million investment by venture capital firm _Aerovent Capital_ in the startup company _Earth Escape._ This will be a _balance concerns_ negotiation. As defined by G. Richard Shell in _Bargaining for Advantage,_ a negotation involves balanced concerns if the immediate substantive stakes and future relationship are in balanced tension with each other. Accordingly, each of you will be scored both on your ability to negotiate favorable contract terms for yourself and on the quality of the relationship you develop with your potential business partner.

****Substantive Points****

Each of you will be given confidential instructions explaining your interests and preferences regarding the substantive terms of the investment and their corresponding point values. Point values for each term are unique to your role and are based on your role's personal, professional, and financial concerns. Do not share this information until the entire excercise, including evaluations, has been completed.

****Process Points****

In addition to your substantive points, each of you also will recieve process points, based on your counterpart's perception of your ability to develop and maintain a positive relationship. After you have concluded the substantive negotation, but before you debrief the excercise, each of you will complete a brief process evaluation in which you assess the degree to which your counterpart met five basic process/relationship interests (such as trust) discussed in the confidential instructions, and in which you award process points accordingly.

****Total Score****

Your total score (Substantive Points + Process Points) reflects your overall success in the negotiation. Your goal is to maximize your personal Total Score. YUniversity our Total Score relects the importance of balancing both substantive and relationship concerns, but if your potential business partner has no desire to work with you again, you have left significant value at the negotiating, and this will be reflected in a lower Total Score.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation

Performance is determined by earning substantive points and process points. 

Substantive points are calculated along 8 metrics: VC equity %, Type of Stock, Dividends, Antidilution, VC board appointments, Vesting, Ceo Replacement, and No shop clause. 

Process points are based on the other participants perception of the relationship. They are scored along 5 metrics: Trust, Respect, Equitability, Regard for other's interests, Interest in Future Collaboration.

To perform well, participants must strike a balance between earning favorable terms for their respective company while maintaining a positive relationship with the other person.
