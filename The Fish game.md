# Summary
This task works to use collective sensing in groups of fish in order to better understand collective intelligence in human groups. To do this, individuals participated in a gradient-sensing task in which every location in this virtual world responded to a score value that changed over time.

# Stimuli
## The visual components
![Fish1](images/Fish1.png)
![Fish2](images/Fish2.png)

> Participants could only see the scores at their avatars' locations
> 
> They could also see the positions, directions, and speeds of all other players
> 
> Players controlled their avatars using the left and right arrow keys to turn and could hold the space bar to accelerate

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
The weighting between the noise field and the spotlight were manipulated to generate different task conditions

# Procedure
## Steps
> Participants either played alone or in groups from 2-6.
> 
> After agreeing to participate, participants were presented with a set of instructions. 
> > These instructions described the mechanics of the game
> > 
> The participants were not informed about the nature of the underlying score fields and were not encouraged to work together
> 
> Participants completed a comprehension test
> 
> Participants were put into a waiting room for up to five minutes or until a pre-assigned number of other players joined the game
> 
> Each participant played in a single game for 6 minutes


## Roles 
Participants had the same role

## Instructions
Will ask

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> The score of a player at a particular point in time was simply determined by the location of that player in the virtual world, which parallels the fishesâ€™ preferences for darker areas in their environment.
> 
> To discourage inactivity, players were awarded a score of zero if their avatars were touching a wall
>
## Incentives
>Participants were paid 50 cents for reading the instructions, and could receive a bonus of up to $1.25 during the six minutes of gameplay
> >These bonuses were the players' cumulative scores divided by the total length of the game times the total possible bonus
>
>They were also paid 12 cents per minute for any time spend in the waiting room, minus any time that player spent against a wall
