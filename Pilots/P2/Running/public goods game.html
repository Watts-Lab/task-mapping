<p>
  Subjects secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public
  pot.
</p>

<p>
  The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less
  than the number of players) and this 'public good' payoff is evenly divided
  among players.
</p>

<p>Each subject also keeps the tokens they do not contribute.</p>
