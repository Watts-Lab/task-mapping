# Summary
>Working from the assumption that groups often make more accurate judgments than individuals, researchers had participants make initial independent estimates of uncertain quantities, discuss their answers in small groups, and revise their estimates.

# Procedure
## Steps
>Experiment 1:
> 1. Cell Phones taken from participants
> 2. Participants are randomly assigned into groups of 3-6; given 2 minutes to introduce themselves
> 3. Participants then answered an estimation question
> 4. Then rated their confidence and the difficulty of the question on a scale of 1-7
> 5. Then participants discussed the question with their groups for 3 minutes to try to improve their answer
> 6. Answered the same question as before
> 7. Repeat steps 3-6 for all questions
> 8. Participants indicated if the group interation improved their second estimates on a scale from -2 to 2.
>
> Experiment 2:
> Same as above but added additional survey questions.
> 
> In step 4, researchers asked participants if they expect to get a lot of help from group discussion.
> 
> At step 8, participants were asked to identify their most accurate group member. 
## Roles 
> Every person had the same role

## Instructions
> The researchers didn’t provide explicit instructions in either the paper or appendix, but did offer tips to calibrate groups in study 2. They urged participants to “elicit reasons from everyone” or “only adjust towards those you trust” or “be honest about what you know and don’t know.”

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> An accurate estimate was considered to be any post discussion answer given within a circumscribed range of the correct answer (e.g. within 5 years for historical dates).

## Incentives
> Study 1 participants were instructed to make estimates that were as accurate as possible. Study 2 participants were incentivized to give accurate estimates but not to compete with their teammates: A $5 Amazon Gift Card was offered to anyone who provided a post-discussion estimate within circumscribed ranges of the correct answers (e.g., within 5 years for historical dates). We encouraged participants to earn as many bonuses as possible and also help their teammates collect bonuses.
