# Summary
This task involves finding the shortest path among a number of “cities” on a map to mimic complex problem solving in which each aspect of a problem depends on other aspects of that problem.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Obtain informed consent
> Each subject took a nine-problem pretest, in part to train them on the TSP and in part to assess their individual abilities with respect to solving TSPs
> Phase One:
> > Subjects were asked to click with the computer’s mouse on the city icons in the sequence corresponding to the path they wished to submit as their answer. The computer program would draw a line segment connecting each pair of cities as soon as the second city in each leg of the journey had been clicked on.
> > Subjects could see the solution they entered in the previous round, in a smaller window below the main task window, along with its distance.
> > Each map consisted of 25 cities and thus required 25 separate legs of the overall journey to complete. Participants complete 6 different maps. 
> > They had 17 tries per map, and 50 seconds per map. If the subject had not submitted an answer by the end of the 50s, the interface automatically moved on.
> Phase Two:
> > Subjects were put into groups of three, and assigned to one of three conditions. Subjects were randomly matched with and anonymous to each other; the order of treatments was also randomly assigned and subjects were exposed to multiple treatments.
> > > CT treatment: subjects could see the previous round’s solutions from the other subjects in their triad (neighbors) along with the distances of those solutions
> > > IT treatment: subjects could see their neighbors’ solutions only on rounds 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16
> > > NT treatment: neighbors’ solutions were never visible.

## Roles 
> All participants had the same role.

Thank you for your participation today. You'll be taking part in a study involving traveling salespersons (TSP). You will work individually for the first part of the experiment, and in groups of three for the second part.

First you will complete the following pretest to assess your knowledge and experience with solving TSPs.

Now, we will begin the task, in which your goal is to find the shortest path among a number of “cities” on a map, visiting each city except the first exactly once. Each path concludes with a return to the first city; thus the first city is visited twice. When the map appears, please click with the computer’s mouse on the city icons in the sequence corresponding to the path you wish to submit as your answer. There are 17 rounds in which you will have 50 seconds to find the solution to this same map. If you do not submit a path within the 50 seconds, you will automatically move into the next round.

For CT:
You have been randomly assigned to a group of three. You will now complete the same task, but you will see the previous round’s solutions from the other subjects in your triad (neighbors) along with the distances of those solutions. This will appear below the main task window next to your own previous solution and its distance. 

For IT:
You have been randomly assigned to a group of three. You will now complete the same task, but you will see the previous round’s solutions from the other subjects in your triad (neighbors) along with the distances of those solutions on rounds 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. This will appear below the main task window next to your own previous solution and its distance. 

For NT:
You have been randomly assigned to a group of three. Please complete the task again as you did in the first phase of the task.

Thank you for your time today.


# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> The quality of solutions was recorded as a distance (to be minimized) and as a number of correct legs. A leg was considered correct if it was part of an optimal solution.

## Incentives
> Subjects were paid $10 for showing up to the experiment, $1 for each pretest problem they found the optimum for, and 50 cents per round during an experimental trial in which they found the optimum
