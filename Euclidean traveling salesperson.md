# Summary
This task involves finding the shortest path among a number of “cities” on a map to mimic complex problem solving in which each aspect of a problem depends on other aspects of that problem.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Obtain informed consent
> Each subject took a nine-problem pretest, in part to train them on the TSP and in part to assess their individual abilities with respect to solving TSPs
> Phase One:
> > Subjects were asked to click with the computer’s mouse on the city icons in the sequence corresponding to the path they wished to submit as their answer. The computer program would draw a line segment connecting each pair of cities as soon as the second city in each leg of the journey had been clicked on.
> > Subjects could see the solution they entered in the previous round, in a smaller window below the main task window, along with its distance.
> > Each map consisted of 25 cities and thus required 25 separate legs of the overall journey to complete. Participants complete 6 different maps. 
> > They had 17 tries per map, and 50 seconds per map. If the subject had not submitted an answer by the end of the 50s, the interface automatically moved on.
> Phase Two:
> > Subjects were put into groups of three, and assigned to one of three conditions. Subjects were randomly matched with and anonymous to each other; the order of treatments was also randomly assigned and subjects were exposed to multiple treatments.
> > > CT treatment: subjects could see the previous round’s solutions from the other subjects in their triad (neighbors) along with the distances of those solutions
> > > IT treatment: subjects could see their neighbors’ solutions only on rounds 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16
> > > NT treatment: neighbors’ solutions were never visible.

## Roles 
> All participants had the same role.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> The quality of solutions was recorded as a distance (to be minimized) and as a number of correct legs. A leg was considered correct if it was part of an optimal solution.

## Incentives
> Subjects were paid $10 for showing up to the experiment, $1 for each pretest problem they found the optimum for, and 50 cents per round during an experimental trial in which they found the optimum
