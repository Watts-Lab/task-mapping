# Oligopoly game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants experience a game with a pre-determined number of rounds. In each round of the game, participants must independently decide whether to "compete" or "collude." Players get a different amount of payoff in each round based on a combination of how they decided and how everyone else in the round decided. The players know the different possible payoffs ahead of time.

Here is an example. Suppose that the four possible pay-offs are as follows: [You choose - "Compete", Majority chooses - "Compete",  Your Payoff - 10], [You choose - "Collude", Majority chooses - "Compete", Your Payoff - 0], [You choose - "Compete", Majority chooses - "Collude", Your Payoff - 40], [You choose - "Collude", Majority chooses - "Collude", Your Payoff - 20]. In this example, you would get the most payoff if you choose to compete, but the majority chooses to collude. 

Let's say that, in the first round, more than half of the players decide to "compete." Then those who choose to "compete" would receive 10 points. Those who choose to "collude” would receive 0 points. Then we will play round 2 ,and everyone will vote all over again. Suppose in round 2 that a majority of players choose to "collude". Then those who choose to “compete” receive 40 points and those who "collude" receive 20 points.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, when making a decision, participants will have to weigh individual benefit against the unknown actions of other players. Notice that, even though the best possible individual outcome (Payoff = 40) is for you to choose "Compete" and for the majority to choose "Collude," if everyone follows this same logic, then the majority will end up being "Compete," and the payoff will only be 10.

Participants must make their decisions in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
analytical skills, problem-solving skills, collaboration

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants should submit the option at the same time in each round. After three seconds, the decision made by “rivals” would be shown to each participant.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants cannot communicate during voting period
