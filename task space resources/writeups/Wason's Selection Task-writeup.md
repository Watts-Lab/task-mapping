# Wason's Selection Task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a conditional sentence in the form of, "If X, then Y." They also see four cards, which have either a letter or a number on the front. The cards are double-sided; those with a letter on the front have a number on the back, and vice versa.

As an example, imagine that the conditional sentence says the following: "If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side."

Then, imagine that the four cards are:

1. D (front), 3 (back)
2. 3 (front), K (back)
3. B (front), 5 (back)
4. 7 (front), D (back)

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to identify which cards, if turned over, would allow the participant to determine if the conditional sentence is true or false. Participants make the selection by clicking on the appropriate cards on the interface.

Consider the example above: "If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side."

This means that if there is a card with D on one side, and something other than 3 on the other side, it would make the sentence false. Thus, the answer for each card is as follows:

1. Card #1: We should select this card; if there is something other than 3 on the back, then the statement would be false.
2. Card #2: We should NOT select this card; whether the other side is D or not does not affect the truth of this statement. If it is D, then the statement is true; if it is not D, it is simply neutral evidence and does not disprove the statement.
3. Card #3: We should NOT select this card; the statement does not say anything about cards with letters other than D.
4. Card #4: We should select this card; if there is a D on the back, then the statement would be false (since D would be paired with a number other than 3).

Selecting Card #1 is an easy decision: since it has a D on the front, it is easy to see that we should check for a 3 on the other side. However, some of the other choices are more difficult and require skillfully applying logic: for example, participants may not notice that they need to check Card #4 to make sure there is not a D on the other side. Participants may also mistakenly choose cards #2 or #3.

For a given sentence, there is a single correct solution (in the example above, choosing both #1 and #4). If participants correctly select exactly the right cards, then they solve the task correctly. If they do not select enough cards (e.g., picking #1 without picking #4) or if they select too many cards (e.g., picking #1, #2, and #4), then they fail the task.
