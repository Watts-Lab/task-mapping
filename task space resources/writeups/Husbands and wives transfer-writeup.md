# Husbands and wives transfer

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a problem that reads as follows:

"On the A-side of the river are wives (W1, W2, W3) and their husbands (H1, H2, H3). All of the men but none of the women can row. Get them across to the B-side of the river by means of a boat carrying only three at one time. No man will allow his wife to be in the presence of another man unless he is also there."

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to achieve the fewest number of trips that get all six people to the B-side, and to solve this problem within the time limit.

There are several possible "shortest" solutions to this problem. In general, participants must realize that solving the problem requires people to row back and forth --- that is, some of the people who go from the A-side to the B-side have to go BACK to the A-side --- and then figure out the right combinations that meet the requirements (W1 cannot be in the presence of H2 or H3 unless H1 is also there, and so on).

Therefore, participants must satisfy the constraints of the problem while also thinking creatively. As a final piece of helpful context, this task is actually a well-known one that many people have built algorithms to solve.
