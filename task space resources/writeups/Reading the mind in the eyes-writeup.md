# Reading the mind in the eyes

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants were given 36 pairs of eyes. Each pair is a photo of a person, cropped so that only the eyes are visible.

Each pair of eyes is intended to convey some sort of emotion --- some of them are squinting with suspicion or wide-eyed with fear; some of them have their eyebrows raised in surprise; others have crinkles at the corners to suggest a smile.

Below the picture of the eyes, participants see four words describing different emotions: for example, "playful," "sad," "irritated," and "comforted."

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to correctly label the eyes with an associated emotion by selecting the right one out of the four words.

Each pair of eyes has an objectively correct label out of the four given. Therefore, participants' goal is to answer all questions correctly. They achieve the highest possible score if they label every pair of eyes with the right emotion. Participants have a limited amount of time to finish the test.
