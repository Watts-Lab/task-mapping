# Estimating Factual Quantities

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a series of questions on estimating certain factual quantities. For example, participants can be asked to estimate the year when DNA was discovered or the current price per share of Twitter stock.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to answer as many questions from the series as correctly as possible within a fixed amount of time, and without looking up the solutions online.

Participants are evaluated based on the percent difference of their estimation from the correct answer. Participants receive the maximum score if all their estimations are exactly like the correct answers and the percent difference between them is 0. Participants maximize their score by submitting estimations that are as close to the right answers as possible. For example, because the DNA was discovered in 1869, participants get the maximum score for this estimation if their guess is 1869, while an estimation of 1860 receives a higher score than an estimation of 1900.
