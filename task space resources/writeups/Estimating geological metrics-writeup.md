# Estimating geological metrics

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a series of questions on estimating geological metrics. For example, participants can be asked to estimate the number of miles from New York to Los Angeles or the number of U.S. states that border the Gulf of Mexico.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to answer a series of questions within a fixed amount of time as close to the correct answer as possible without looking up the solutions online.

Participants are evaluated based on the percent difference of their estimation from the correct answer. Participants receive the maximum score if their estimation is exactly like the correct answer and the percent difference between them is 0. Participants maximize their score by submitting an estimation that is as close to the right answer as possible. For example, because the distance between New York and Los Angeles is 2446.3 miles, participants get the maximum score if their estimation is 2446.3, while an estimation of 2400 miles receives a higher score than an estimation of 2000 miles.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
