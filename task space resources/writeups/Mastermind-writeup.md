## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get a series of pegs, or points, of different colors to use in a logic game played on the computer. For example, participants can get 6 colors to use during the game: blue, red, green, orange, yellow, and purple.

As the game begins, an algorithm randomly designates a color pattern as the correct answer to the game. For example, the correct pattern to the game can consist of 4 colors, in this order: yellow, orange, yellow, red.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to identify all the colors and their positions from the correct pattern, using as few trials as possible and within a fixed amount of time.

As the game begins, participants have a limited number of trials to propose color patterns. Participants receive immediate feedback in the form of black and white pegs after each trial. A white peg means that one of the colors they chose is in the pattern (but in the wrong position); a black peg means that one of the colors they chose has both the color and the position correct.

For example, if the correct pattern is yellow, orange, yellow, red, and a participant proposes blue, green, orange, red, then this participants correctly identifies two colors from the pattern and a position of one of them correctly. Therefore, they would receive a white peg for orange (correct color, wrong position) and a black peg for red (correct color, correct position). However, participants don't know from the feedback exactly which color and position they identified correctly; instead, they have to try to deduce it from feedback for each trial.

Participants try to guess the pattern using as few tries as possible, and get the highest score by receiving as many pegs, especially black ones, as early in the game as possible.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes
