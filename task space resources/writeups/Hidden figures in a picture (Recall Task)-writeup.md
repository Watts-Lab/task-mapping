# Hidden figures in a picture (Recall Task)

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see an incredibly busy and complex image that contains many hidden animals. Imagine a picture that looks like "Where's Waldo" --- with lots of people and animals in one detailed, colorful image. Participants are then given a list of animals that they are supposed to find in the picture: for example, lion, penguin, dolphin, elephant.

If working together, participants in a team see the same picture and have the same list of animals to find.

Participants then engage in a task in which everyone working together attempts to find as many animals from the list as they can in the provided image. For example, if "elephant" is on the list, they need to look for the elephant in the picture, and then click on it.

After a delay, participants are taken to a page where they can type and submit words.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the task is to be able to recall as many animals as they can from the original list. Participants type and submit the words using the webpage. They have a limited amount of time to submit all the words that they can remember.

If working together, only one participant on a team needs to remember the word in order for everyone to receive credit.

Participants are scored based on the number of animals from the original list that they are able to recall. For example, if there were 10 animals on the list, they would get the maximum score if they recalled all 10 animals.
