# Putting food into categories

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants were provided with a shared list containing several (e.g., a dozen) fruit and vegetable items. For example, you might have a list with the words, "orange," "grapes," "peach," "apple," etc. 

Everyone in the team sees the same list, and the contents of the list stay the same for a given round.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to generate as many different ideas as possible for categories that could be used to divide the food items. 

These ideas are purely abstract concepts meant to demonstrate creativity: e.g., "how many ways can you think of to put these food items into different categories?" For example, they could divide the fruit into citrus vs non-citrus, tropical vs non-tropical, seeds versus no seeds, or any number of possibly wild or imaginative ideas (things you can feed an elephant vs things you cannot feed an elephant).

Participants must come up with as many criteria for dividing the food items as they can within a limited amount of time. To submit, they simply type the ideas into the system. Those working together can see all ideas generated by everyone in the team so far.

Finally, credit is awarded for the total number of non-redundant ideas that participants came up with. That is, participants would only get credit once even if they submit the same idea multiple times, but it is OK if a different team also submitted the same idea.
