# Railroad Route Construction game

Mapped by: joycewang3 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see a shared visual of a map, consisting of a grid in which each square is a place where players can place a "railroad track" piece. Some parts of the map are blocked off --- for example, because there is a tree or other obstacle in that location --- and therefore railroad tracks cannot be placed there. There is a "start" and "finish" marked on the map.

Participants also get a collection of several different types of railroad tracks. Some track pieces are bent like an elbow, and there are versions that bend downwards, bend upwards, and so on. Other pieces are straight. Participants are given enough pieces to be able to build a railroad that connects the start and finish.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the game is to build a railroad using the given puzzle pieces to connect the starting point to the finish point. Participants have to avoid the obstacles (places where you cannot place railroad tracks) --- therefore, they need to use a mixture of bent tracks and straight tracks to navigate the map. Any path that runs smoothly from the start to the finish counts as a success, so there is no specific final path or "ideal" route.

Participants must finish the game before the time runs out, but are able to visually see their progress on the screen throughout the game (since everyone is clicking, dragging, and interacting with it directly). Participants are evaluated on whether or not they are able to connect the start to the finish: if they do not make it in time, they receive no credit. There is no partial credit for building only part of the railroad.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
visual imagination, cognitive skills, problem solving skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
The participants are shown a board with a bank of railroad pieces on the left side of the screen. As participants placed pieces on the board, a piece from the bank of pieces will be greyed out so that piece could no longer be selected. Display at the end of each round whether the group as a whole succeeded or failed. Utterances in the neutral and vulnerable conditions are shown on the screen as if they were spoken by the robot after each player have completed their track and the overall score is shown

### Other Allowed Processes
The task was preprogrammed to win or lose a certain set of rounds. On rounds programmed to lose, the final necessary piece of track was not available to the human during that round.
