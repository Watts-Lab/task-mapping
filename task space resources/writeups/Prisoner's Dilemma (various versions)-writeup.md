# Prisoner's Dilemma (various versions)

Mapped by: sky1113 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a choice to "cooperate" or "defect" and are given, in advance, the payoff to be expected for each choice, and when appropriate, the combination of choices between participants. The expected payoffs are the same for all participants. Each participant independently makes their choice without discussion. This process is repeated for a predetermined number of rounds.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. For example, let us consider a simple two-player game. If both participants cooperate, they'll both lose a small amount, and if both defect, they will lose a large amount. If one participant cooperates while the other defects, the cooperator will lose a large amount while the defector loses nothing. In this scenario, the participants must balance the temptation of defecting and the risk of their opponent doing the same to minimize their losses. Participants must also make each decision in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical Thinking, Decision Making, Risk Management

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Viewing decision payoffs, Selecting "cooperation" or "defection", View total payoff across rounds, Viewing opposing participantâ€™s decision, Viewing round payoff, Playing a set number of rounds in sequence


### Other Allowed Processes
The payoff for "cooperating" or "defecting" can be manipulated
The actions to choose from may be changed (ex. choose red or blue, choose to take a payout or give it to others, etc)
Participants may work in teams, in which case, teams are able to communicate within themselves for a fixed amount of time prior to making a decision
