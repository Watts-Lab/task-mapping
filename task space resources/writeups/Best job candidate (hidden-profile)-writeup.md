# Best job candidate (hidden-profile)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants read information about three candidates who supposedly had applied for an assistant professorship. Each candidate's profile included positive, neutral, and negative characteristics, and the characteristics are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (negative) to 7 (positive). Not all information, however, is shared among group members. The information is distributed to create a hidden profile. For example, each group member knows only two of candidate A's six positive characteristics, and only one of candidate B's negative characteristics. For candidate C, they knew only one positive and one negative characteristic. Thus, based on the shared information, candidate B seemingly has more positive and fewer negative characteristics and therefore would be the preferred candidate. Only by exchanging information through group discussion could the group members detect the best alternative, candidate A.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for each group is to reach an agreement on the best candidate they would hire. The task is designed so that the full information would show that a candidate among the three is objectively the best (the "correct answer"). Through discussion and sharing of information, the group should find out the optimal candidate within the time limit.
