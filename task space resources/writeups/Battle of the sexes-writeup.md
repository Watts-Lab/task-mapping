## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired with a different anonymous opponent for a predetermined number of decision-making rounds. In each round, both players must make a decision. The final outcome for the players is determined by the decision of both parties.

Throughout the rounds, the players have access to a shared table that displays the possible outcomes, depending on each player's decision. For example, suppose that each player has 3 options. Then the rows might represent Player 1's options, and the columns might represent Player 2's options. There would be 3x3 = 9 possible outcomes, and the 9 cells of the table would contain the number of points that the players would earn based on their choices. For example, if Player 1 chooses their first option and Player 2 chooses their second option, then the final outcome would be determined by the number of points listed in row 1, column 2.

Some outcomes are better than others. Thus, in order to get a better outcome, players have the option to use non-binding one-way communication to signal that they may choose a particular row or column, so that the other player can attempt to coordinate. The process of communication is as follows:

- The participant is asked if they would like to make an announcement. They may select either yes or no.

- If they select yes, they will be asked what they would like to announce. They may select any of the actions that will be available to them during the decision-making period (for example, "I intend to selection option 2"). The opposing participant will then be told of their selection.

- If they select no, the opposing participant will be told an announcement was not made.

Players can choose to communicate one or more times. After all communications are complete, the participants will then independently select their actions, and each will receive the number of points corresponding to this combination of actions in their table. Players are not required to actually select the action they previously announced.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for each participant is to maximize their earnings (points) through the decision-making rounds. Therefore, they should wisely make announcements and selections in order to obtain the highest value in the payoff table. The best outcome is when both players make choices that lead to the the highest possible payoff. In all rounds, participants are required to make choices for their announcements (if applicable) and their actions in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical thinking, Decision-making

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Viewing current payoff matrix for assigned position, Clicking to select whether or not to make an announcement, Clicking to select what to announce, Viewing other participantâ€™s announcement, Experiencing a sequence of communication rounds prior to action selection, Clicking to select their action for the round, Viewing current winnings, Viewing number generated in lottery vs points earned, Playing rounds with different partners in sequence



### Other Allowed Processes
The payoff matrices are different depending on their current assignment, The values within the payoff matrices can be manipulated, The number of actions to select from can be manipulated, The number of announcements and their arrangement (only one player is given the option, both are given the option, both are given the option three times) varies and can be manipulated
