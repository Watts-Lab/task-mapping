# Iterated Snowdrift Game (Without Punishment)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired in a group acting as two drivers who are caught in a blizzard and trapped on either side of a snowdrift. They can either get out and start shoveling ("cooperate") or remain in the car ("defect").

If both cooperate, they have the benefit of getting home while sharing the labor. Thus, Rewards = (benefit - labor)/ 2. If both defect, they do not get anywhere and hence incur the punishment, meaning Rewards = 0. If only one shovels, however, they both get home; however, the defector is able to free-ride and avoids the labor cost while reaping all the benefits (Rewards = benefit). In contrast, the cooperator gets fewer Rewards, as they have to put in all the labor (Reward = benefit - labor). We assume benefit is greater than labor, as both parties want to get home.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize their individual payoff (Rewards) and are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to make a decision. Letting the opponent do all the work is the best option for your individual payoff, but if the other player stays in the car, it is better to shovel. The worst outcome is if both players choose to stay in the car. 

For example, imagine that there are three groups in the game. In Group 1, both player A and player B decide to cooperate. In Group 2, player C remains in the car while player D gets out and starts shoveling. In Group 3, neither player E nor player F is willing to cooperate. The payoff values of different players rank in order: player C > player A/player B > player D > player E/player F.
