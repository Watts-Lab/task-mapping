# Space Fortress

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants see a video game, in which a "space fortress" is at the center of the screen. The fortress can rotate in all directions and fire off "shells" at anyone who attempts to attack it.

In this game, each subject controls a spaceship, which is able to fly around freely and shoot missiles at the space fortress. As they approach the space fortress, subjects must also dodge "mines," which periodically appear on the screen and chase the subject's ship. If a mine hits the subject's ship, the spaceship will suffer damage. However, some special floating objects --- which appear to be mines --- will actually give the subject a "power-up" and damage the space fortress instead.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal of the game is to maximize points by destroying the space fortress. Participants need to attack the space fortress as much as possible while avoiding damage from enemy attacks and mines. This game can be either single-player or multiplayer; in either case, the objective is the same.

To summarize, participants earn points when:

1. They successfully hit the fortress;
2. The fortress is destroyed (which requires hitting it repeatedly and progressively weakening it);
3. Participants earn a bonus in the game (e.g., through a power-up);
4. The participants destory or neutralize a mine.

On the other hand, participants lose points when:

1. Their ship is damaged (e.g., by an enemy shell or a mine);
2. Their ship is destroyed (which occurs after the ship suffers too much damage);
3. The participant runs out of missiles.

Participants are evaluated on their final game score.
