# Aerospace Investment (Role-playing)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly paired for a scored negotiation over a venture capital investment. Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the venture capitalist investor or the founder of the aerospace company. Both individuals are scored on their ability to negotiate favorable investment terms for themselves and on the quality of the relationship they develop with their potential business partner. Each negotiator's Total Score is a sum of Substantive Points, awarded according to the agreed-upon terms of the investment, and Process Points, awarded according to each partner's perception of the negotiation process.

Specifically, each negotiable term of the investment is quantified as specific point values. After the term sheet has been agreed upon, participants independently fill out questionnaires that ask them to evaluate each other on five attributes to determine the amount of Process Points they are awarded. The five process attributes are: trust, respect, equitability, regard for the other's interests, and interest in future collaboration. These attributes serve as proxies for assessing the future of the business relationship based on their experiences during the negotiation.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are explicitly instructed that their goal is to maximize their Total Scores (Substantive Points + Process Points), and were given a limited amount of time (e.g., 30 minutes) to conduct their negotiation. The total score reflects the overall success of balancing both substantive and relationship concerns. For instance, the founders may be able to negotiate all the substantive terms in their favor, but if their potential business partners have no desire to work with them again, they would have left significant value at the negotiating table, and this will be reflected in a lower Total Score.
