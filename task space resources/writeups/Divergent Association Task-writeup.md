# Divergent Association Task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a task sheet with instructions, a blank space to write 10 words in, and a list of rules.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to come up with 10 nouns as different from each other as possible within a fixed amount of time. For example, words "cat" and "dog" are considered similar to each other because they are often used in the same context, while words "cat" and "thimble" are different because they are rarely used together.

Participants are evaluated on how semantically different the words are. The minimum score occurs when all the words are the same, while the theoretical maximum score occurs when words have the least possible relation to each other. Participants maximize their score by coming up with as many of the most semantically distant words as possible.
