# Mock jury

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are to act as jurors in a mock jury. Once they have read the summary of the trial, they will be given a brief pre-deliberation questionnaire. They should take into account all facts of the trial and any specific instructions given by the judge before filling out the questionnaire and continuing with the process. In the questionnaire, participants are asked to record their personal verdict for the trial, and their assuredness of this verdict, which are indicated on a 9-point scale. The scale ranged from 1 (definitely not guilty) to 9 (definitely guilty), and 1 (not at all) to 9 (very confident).

After they finish the questionnaire, all the jury members will be instructed on the laws surrounding the case. All participants will then deliberate and attempt to reach a unanimous verdict. The jury is allowed to deliberate for a limited time (e.g. 1 hour) until they reach a verdict.

Then all jurors will once again be given questionnaires where they will render their individual verdict, and record their assuredness of the verdict.
