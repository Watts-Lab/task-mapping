# Minimal Group Paradigm (study diversity)

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly and anonymously divided into two groups (e.g., "Group A" and "Group B"). After they are divided into groups, participants receive an anonymous list of players (e.g., "participant number 34 of Group A," "participant number 12 of Group B"). They are then asked to distribute a valuable resource (e.g., money or points) between the participants on the list. Participants are told that, after the task is finished, they will receive the total amount of the resource that has been allocated to them by the other participants.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for participants is simply to allocate the resources however they like. There are no right or wrong answers for how participants should divide up the resources. Participants do NOT need to maximize the resources of people on their own team, nor maximize their personal resources.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
analytical skills

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Participants can input the number of resources to allocate to other players. They can allocate resources to more than one person.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants cannot communicate during the resource allocation stage
