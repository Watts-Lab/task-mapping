# Abstract grid task

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a shared grid, in which some squares in the grid are colored in, and other squares in the grid are not colored in. The grid is interactive, and offers the opportunity to change the squares' colors by either "adding" color where a square is not filled in, or "substracting" color where a square is already filled in (removing the color from the square).

Clicking a particular square on the grid "toggles" the color --- shifting it from colored to non-colored, or vice versa.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to make the grid appear exactly symmetrical from left-to-right and top-to-bottom using the fewest number of clicks. (Each click represents one manipulation --- either adding or subtracting color from the grid.)

Each problem has a known "lowest" number of clicks, which represents the best possible answer. However, participants are not given any feedback about whether their answer was the best. Finally, participants must complete the task within the time limit.
