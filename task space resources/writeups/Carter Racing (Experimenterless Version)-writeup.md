# Carter Racing (Experimenterless Version)

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get several pages of description about a dilemma facing a racecar team, which involves deciding whether to go ahead with a race that would begin in the immediate future. The description mentions that the team has been experiencing a series of engine failures and that an engine failure during this race on national television will present a danger to the driver and team's sponsorship. However, if the team does well on the race, it will get a lucrative sponsorship deal.

In particular, this race day has unusual temperatures, and participants are told that the outside temperature could be related to engine failures in the past. Participants are given charts with information about the outside temperatures during previous races in the season, and whether or not there was an engine failure during those previous races. Some of these charts may focus just on the successful races, while others may focus only on the failed ones --- as a result, the presentation of the data requires the participant to do work to piece the full picture together.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to come up with reasons and ultimately decide to terminate the participation in the race within a fixed amount of time. Everyone working together submits their decision in a shared interface.

The data in the description is gathered from the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident in 1986. The relationship between ambient temperature and O-ring failure is disguised as the relationship between air temperature and car engine failures. In other words, participants that decide to go ahead with the race make a decision that is parallel to the decision to go ahead with the Space Shuttle Challenger launch.

Participants have to recognize that, once they are able to piece the full picture together from the information they are given, there is a clear relationship between temperature and engine failure. Based on the temperature of the day, they should predict that the car's engine will fail, causing them to lose the sponsorship.

Therefore, the only correct and precise solution to the task is not to proceed with the race, while participants that come up with a conclusion to proceed with the race fail the task. Participants also have to explain their reasoning behind this decision by finding a relationship between engine failures and air temperatures.
