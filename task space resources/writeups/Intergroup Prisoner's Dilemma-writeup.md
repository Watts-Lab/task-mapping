# Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
All participants are given a fixed amount of individual money ("endowment") and divided into two groups, A and B.  Participants are told that their group is competing with the other group to see which one "invests" the most money. The winning group receives a larger cash prize.

Every individual player in the group must make an independent decision to either invest their personal endowment or keep it for themselves. The group wins or loses depending on the number of players that chose to invest relative to the other group. For example, if everyone in Group A invests and no one in Group B invests, Group A would win the entire cash prize and split it among its members. If some people from both groups invest, but more people from Group A invest than people from Group B, then the two groups would split the cash prize (but Group A would get more of it). Finally, if the same number of people in Groups A and B invest (a tie), then the two groups would split the cash prize 50-50.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, when making a decision, participants have to weigh up the cost of losing their individual endowment with the expected gain from splitting the cash prize if their group wins. Since the outcome depends on not only the participant's personal choice, but also the choices of all other players, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty and risk. For example, a participant could choose to invest, only to find that their group has lost (not enough other players invested), and they end up with less money than when they started. On the other hand, there is a greater chance of winning the maximum cash prize if everyone in the group invests.

Participants must make their decisions in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical Thinking, Decision Making, Risk Management

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Viewing decision payoffs, selecting whether to invest or not, View total number of people who chose to invest across groups, View round payoff

### Other Allowed Processes
The different payoffs for winning and losing groups, as well as the initial endowment, can be manipulated. In another version of this came, "Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma - Maximizing Difference," participants can choose to invest in one of two different options: one option benefits the participant's own group at a personal cost, while the other option harms the out-group.
