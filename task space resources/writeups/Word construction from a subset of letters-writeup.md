# Word construction from a subset of letters

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are presented with nine letters. For example: A, F, H, B, E, J, N, K, D.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to produce as many valid four-letter English words as possible from a given set of nine letters within a fixed amount of time. For example, out of the set of letters above, words such as "bean," "head,", "khan," "dean" and many others can be formed. Although there is a theoretical maximum score if participants exhaust all the possible combinations of letters to form four-letter words, the goal is simply to generate as many words as participants can within the time limit.

Participants submit their words through an online system. Words that are not valid in English or that are longer than four letters will be rejected by the system. Those working in teams can brainstorm in any way they wish; the total number of non-repeated words submitted by the team will be counted.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
English fluency, vocabulary

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
View letters, produce words

### Other Allowed Processes
The subset of letters did not allow for the participants to create the target words from the Hidden figures experiment.
