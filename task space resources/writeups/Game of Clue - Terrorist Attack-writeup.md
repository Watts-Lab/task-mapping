# Game of Clue - Terrorist Attack

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants work in a shared web interface in which they solve a 'who-done-it' game like Clue or Cluedo, but involving a terrorist threat. Everyone in the game is solving the same puzzle.

Each participant has a personal "inbox" where they have their own list of facts and clues. In addition, at specified intervals of time, participants are able to use a "search engine" tool to look for more clues, which then appear in their inbox. For those who are working in groups, participants also have the ability to share clues by sending them to each other and to add comments to each other's clues.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal was to solve for four facts:

1. Who would carry out the terrorist attack
2. What would be the target
3. Where the attack would take place
4. When the attack would take place.

The game is designed so that there is exactly one correct answer for each of these four facts.

Participants submit their final answers via the web interface. Since there are multiple facts that need to be solved, participants are able to submit one "solved" fact at a time. They are also able to return to the submission page to change their answers at any point before the time limit ends. Participants are not given any feedback about whether their submissions are right or wrong, but when playing in a group, they are able to view what other people have been guessing so far (which can help provide a hint).

Participants are evaluated not only for correctly finding the exact facts, but also for solving the mystery as quickly as possible --- they earn more points for finding each fact faster. Therefore, someone who finds all 4 facts in 2 minutes will earn more points than someone who submits the same answers, but takes 5 minutes to reach their conclusion.
