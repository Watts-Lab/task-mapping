# Minimum-effort tacit coordination game

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants play in a large group with others. Each participant is given a list of numbers from 1 to 7. In every round, participants must independently choose and submit one of the numbers as their "guess."

Each participant's guess will then be compared to the median guess across all participants. Before making their guesses, participants receive a payoff table that explains how much money they would earn for their guess, depending on how close it was to the median, and on the value of the median. In general, participants earn more money if their guess is closer to the median, and if the median is higher (i.e., closer to 7). Participants win less money if their guess is farther away from the median (e.g., the median was 4 and they guess 5), and if the median is lower (i.e., closer to 1). Additionally, participants suffer a greater penalty for "overshooting" (guessing higher than the median) than they do for "undershooting" (guessing lower than the median).

This process is repeated for a predetermined number of rounds.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. The highest possible payoff is if the participant correctly guesses the median, and the median is 7. However, if the true median is lower than 7, the best payoff in the round is to correctly guess the median value and to avoid overshooting. Guessing too high (for example, choosing 7 when the median is 4) would result in a penalty. 

Therefore, participants must balance the tradeoff between guessing a large value, which boosts the median and the overall payoff, and guessing a value that is too large, which results in the overshooting penalty. Additionally, there is a tradeoff between individual gain and collective benefit: if a participant chooses 6 or 7, they would boost the median value (which would increase the overall payoff), but they would be more likely to personally overshoot (leading to the penalty). On the other hand, if the participant chooses 1 or 2, they would decrease the overall payoff, but reduce their own chances of overshooting.

Participants must also make each decision in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills
