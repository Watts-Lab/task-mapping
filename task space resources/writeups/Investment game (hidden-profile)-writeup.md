## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are asked to take the role of the board of directors of an investment company. Their task is to evaluate three companies available for acquisition using a specified set of investment criteria and to provide a rank ordering of the companies' desirability. Profiles on each of the three companies include the financial opinions of in-house and external financial analysts, information on the company's business strategy, strength of its management team, market position, and human resources practices. The investment criteria for evaluating the companies include long-term financial return, the degree of risk tolerated, the ability of the company to stand on its own and fit with the company's general business philosophy.

Each participant is given different information about the investment options, which means that initial majority and minority opinions are likely to be divided. Participants are then asked to discuss the investment strategy. After they discuss, the group must come to an agreement on how to rank-order the three company from best to worst investment.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal for each group is to reach an agreement on the correct rank ordering of the three companies based on the information they receive. The task is designed so that the full information would show that one company is objectively the best, one is in second place, and one is objectively the worst. Through discussion and sharing of information, the group should find out the "correct decision" within the time limit.
