# Dictator game and its variants

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are placed into pairs and randomly assigned the role of "dictator" or "receiver." In each round of the game, the dictator sees an amount of money (the "endowment") on the screen, as well as an option to give part of the money to the receiver. After choosing how much to give to the receiver, the dictator keeps the remaining funds, while the receiver keeps the amount that was given to them by the dictator. The receiver is required to accept whatever the dictator chooses to give them and has no option to reject the offer. 

The same pairs play together for a predetermined number of rounds and roles are reassigned each round.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant has the goal of maximizing their own earnings. In the dictator role, participants must decide how much they will offer (from $0 to the full endowment). Since the dictator knows that the receiver cannot reject the offer, it is in the dictator's interest to give the receiver nothing ($0), because they would then keep the full amount.

However, there are a few reasons why dictators may choose to give more than $0. Giving nothing may conflict with social norms (because the dictator would then be seen as self-serving), or simply feel morally "unjust." If there is more than one round being played, dictators may worry that their relationship and reputation with their partner may be harmed in later rounds. The dictator must weigh these considerations and decide on a final amount to give to the receiver.

Participants must also make their decisions in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Analytical Thinking, Decision Making

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Different views for dictators and receivers, Inputting a valid amount of the endowment to split, Playing a set number of rounds with the same partner and different role assignments

### Other Allowed Processes
Different variations of the game can allow for different amounts of endowment, as well as different allowed actions: for example, dictators can be given the option to accept a fixed amount and quietly "exit" the game (so that they can absolve themselves of the moral consequences of choosing to give the receiver a low amount). Receivers can also be given a filler task to perform while they are idle. In another variation, the dictator can choose to take money from the receiver, rather than give money to the receiver. Another variation involves the dictator and receiver being groups of people (rather than individuals). A final variation involves the dictator's decision being communicated as a simple note of, "Thank you for your time today. An additional $__ is attached to this note," rather than letting the receiver know that the dictator chose to give them that amount.
