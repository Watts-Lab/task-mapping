# Object based generalization for reasoning (Phyre)

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants get a series of puzzles related to properties of physical objects in a simulated 2D world on a computer. Access is given to all puzzles at once and participants can choose which puzzles to work on.

For example, in one of the puzzles, participants can view an environment with two blue and green balls on little platforms floating in space, with a slanted floor at the bottom. Considering this scenario, participants are asked to make the green ball and blue ball touch.

Participants are expected to solve puzzles by adding physical objects to the environment so that when the physical simulation is run, the puzzle gets solved. For example, the participant could use an object to knock the blue and green balls off of their floating platforms, and cause them to roll down the ramp and touch (thus completing the puzzle). There are many ways to creatively add objects to the environment and cause different physical consequences.

## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to solve as many puzzles in as few attempts as possible within a fixed amount of time. The maximum score occurs when all puzzles are solved during their first attempts. 

After each unsuccessful attempt, the environment resets to its initial state and participants can try again until they run out of time, or decide to try a different puzzle.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Physical reasoning

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
View all puzzles, click on puzzle, add physical object, run the physical simulation.

### Other Allowed Processes
NA
