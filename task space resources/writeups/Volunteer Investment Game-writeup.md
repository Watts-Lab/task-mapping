# Volunteer Investment Game

Mapped by: Ye-Huifang 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are randomly and anonymously assigned to groups of three in each of the ten rounds. Members of the group are given a limited amount of time (e.g. two minutes) to make an investment decision. Individual earnings are $1 in the event that no one invests before the end of the game. Once one group member makes the investment, the round ends. The individual making the investment secures payment of $1.25, while the other two group members each receive $2. The investor is randomly determined in the event that multiple parties simultaneously invest. Participants are not allowed to communicate with other group members in any way.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize their individual payoff as well as the group's total payoff. It means that one goal is to maximize their personal earnings, which means that they should not invest anything; rather, they should wait for others to invest. But another goal is to optimize the group's outcomes, which means that at least one person in the group should invest. Participants should try to maximize both individual and group outcomes, which causes a tradeoff. They are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 2 minutes) to play the game.
