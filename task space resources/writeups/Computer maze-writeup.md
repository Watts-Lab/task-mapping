# Computer maze

Mapped by: paniukhina 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
Participants are given a computer monitor with a virtual maze environment and either a keyboard or a joystick. The maze consists of a long winding corridor with many hallways branching off. The hallways are populated by complex unfamiliar objects called "greebles," which are difficult to distinguish from one another. A maze contains a certain number of pairs of identical greebles and a certain number of distractor greebles.


## 2. Goal Directives 
The goal is to navigate through the entire maze and tag as many identical greeble pairs as possible within a fixed amount of time. 

Participants are evaluated based on maze navigating and greebles tagging. Participants receive points for navigating through the entire maze and don't receive, but also don't lose, any points for not going through the entire maze. Participants get points for tagging identical greeble pairs and lose points for tagging distracing greebles or mixing greebles from other pairs. The maximum score occurs when participants both navigate through the entire maze and tag all greeble pairs correctly.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.

### Skills 
Spatial navigation, object visualization.

### UI-UX Allowed Processes
Complete a pre-screening, view task instructions, navigate two small practice mazes during practice period, view feedback during practice period, navigate maze 1 in a virtual maze environment, freely discuss task in pairs between maze 1 and maze 2, navigate maze 2, tag a greeble pair with either keyboard or joystick.

### Other Allowed Processes
Participants were assigned either a "navigator" role or a "tagger" role. In the diverse condition, the individual high in spatial visualization was given the role of the navigator, and the individual high in object visualization was assigned the role of a tagger. In the homogeneous conditions, these roles were randomly assigned.
