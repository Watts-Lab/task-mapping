# Chicken

Mapped by: xehu 

## 1. Stimulus Complex 
The game of Chicken simulates a potential confrontation between two players in which each player has the choice to either "Dare" the other player or to "Chicken out." Participants are given a set of payoffs in advance, and depending on each participant's choices, they can obtain different outcomes. In general, participants get a large benefit if they "Dare" the other player and the other player "Chickens out." If both players "Chicken out," participants each get a small benefit. If both players choose to "Dare" the other, then they get a penalty.

Each participant independently makes their choice without discussion. This process is repeated for a predetermined number of rounds.

## 2. Goal Directives 
Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. The participants must balance the temptation of "Daring" the other person and the risk of their opponent doing the same to minimize their losses. Participants must also make each decision in a fixed amount of time.

## 3. Allowed Group Processes 
The following details are not the main parts of the task, but rather additional information about ways in which participants could interact.
