Euclidean traveling salesperson,"<h2>Euclidean traveling salesperson</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different ""paths"" by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a ""path"" between A and B. All participants, who are working on individual screens, are shown a shared map of the cities and can click and interact with it simultaneously.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to find and select the precise shortest path through the cities within a fixed amount of time. This is the sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a ""traveling salesman"" who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant's goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.</p><p>Participants are evaluated on how close the path they found was to the optimal shortest path. They will be able to see the length of the current path they found, but they will not be told that they have reached the optimum.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/a27330d4c7a26ebac960b30d32d5dee6cfed1420,tasks/summaries/Euclidean traveling salesperson-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f

To evacuate or not to evacuate,"<h2>To evacuate or not to evacuate</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants read about a situation in which 'a disaster may or may not strike.' They are given information about the risk level of the disaster, as well as a button to ""evacuate"" from the disaster. </p><p>Evacuating from the disaster costs money &mdash; participants lose half their bonus if they choose to evacuate. However, if they don't evacuate and the disaster happens, then they lose their entire bonus. Therefore, this task is about weighing up the different risks and rewards of clicking the ""evacuate"" button.</p><p>Participants only find out whether the disaster happened or not at the very end of the game. All participants are equally affected by the disaster, but they make their selection for evacuation individually.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to make a decision regarding whether or not to evacuate. Participants have a limited amount of time to make their decision.</p><p>Choosing NOT to evacuate means that there is high risk (you could get nothing), but potential for a high reward.

Search for Oil Task,"<h2>Search for Oil Task</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Pariticipants view a shared 12x12 grid of points, creating a digital ""map"". Each point represents a section of ""land"" in a theoretical oil field. A limited number of these points have been pre-determined by the makers of the game to contain ""oil,"" while others contain nothing. </p><p>Participants are also given some information about which points might be more likely (but not certain!) to contain the oil. For example, they are told that some parts of this grid represent land with the appropriate chemical composition, making it more probable that there will be oil there. (Other pieces of information that make oil more or less likely include information about the surface hardness, surface mantle thickness, and geological stratification of the area.)</p><p>After being shown the detailed information for a limited amount of time, participants have to remember as much information as they can and then decide where they want to ""drill"" completely from memory. During the main gameplay, participants see just the 12x12 map, where they are able to click on each point if they want to drill there.</p><p>As participants select which locations they want to drill, they are given feedback after each decision. For example, after participants pick a point on the 12x12 grid to drill oil, they will be told whether they were right or wrong about oil being there, and they will see the running total of their score.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal of the task is to decide which of the 144 sections of land is suitable for drilling oil, and to do so as accurately as possible before the game's time limit runs out. In other words, participants have to remember and account for all the information they were provided about where oil is most likely to be found, and then decide where they want to ""drill"" (by clicking on the point on the map).</p><p>Participants aim to get the highest possible score, and they earn points for every location with oil that they successfully find. They lose points if they select locations that do not have oil. Therefore, one would get the maximum score of this game by correctly finding every point with oil without making any mistakes.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/6d3cc0d689bfc7f7ae069f983a92debe79c5a8fc,tasks/summaries/Search for Oil Task-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f

But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.</p><p>If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.</p><p>The farmer's challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?""</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to achieve the fewest number of trips that get the wolf, goat, and cabbage from one river bank to another, and to solve this problem within the time limit.</p><p>There are a few different possible solutions that get to the lowest number. All of the solutions require the participants take the goat over first, because any other action will lead to something being eaten. Once the farmer comes back, though, there is a dilemma, because if he takes the wolf over, the wolf would eat the goat on the other side; if he takes the cabbage over, the goat would eat the cabbage on the other side.</p><p>The ""trick"" to this problem is to realize that the farmer can actually take the goat BACK on his return trip: that is, he takes either the wolf or cabbage with him on the second trip. Then, he takes the goat BACK to the ORIGINAL side. He then picks up the remaining one of the cabbage or wolf, and finally, he goes back with the goat. Realizing that you can actually bring things back and forth (in both directions), rather than just in one direction across the river, usually requires some out-of-the-box thinking.</p><p>Therefore, participants must satisfy the constraints of the problem while also thinking creatively.

This problem is shared among everyone who is working together.</p><p>Here is an example question: There are five couples who vacationed at five different ski resorts. Based on the clues, figure out which couple vacationed where. Participants would get a set of clues to solve this problem, such as ""Neither Tammy nor Sue vacationed in Innsbruck,"" ""Both Rita and Mrs. Owens returned from their vacations with broken wrists,"" ""no one at Tahoe was injured that weekend,"" and so on.

Target Search,"<h2>Target Search</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants view a labeled spreadsheet with 100 squares on it. The columns are given letters and the rows are given numbers (so, each blank cell has a letter-number coordinate, like A5, E10, etc.).</p><p>While these cells on the spreadsheet appear blank to the participant, each one is actually connected behind the scenes to a specific value that only the experimenter can see. On the experimenter's side, there is essentially an invisible ""target"" &mdash; the cells are grouped into concentric circles. This ""target"" shape determines the point value of each cell. Cells located in the middle of the target are worth more points than cells near the edges of the target. The closer to the center of the target a cell is, the more points it is worth. If a cell is outside of the target entirely, it is worth 0 points.</p><p>For example, imagine that E10 is the center of the target. Then E10 is worth the most points. A cell that is next to the target (E11) is worth the second-most number of points, whereas a cell that is far away from the target (e.g., A5) would be worth fewer points (or zero, if it is outside the target).</p><p>Of course, since the participants do not see the target, they have no idea how many points each cell is worth.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to get the most points. In other words, participants need to find the coordinates of as many high-value cells as they can within a fixed amount of time and under a limited number of allowed guesses.</p><p>For each guess, participants submit the coordinate of a blank cell (e.g., A5) and then get feedback about how many points they received. Based on feedback, they would try to figure out where the the experimenter's underlying ""target"" is and look for the high-scoring cells. If they are working in teams, participants work together to determine their next guess.</p><p>After a few guesses, participants can often ""decipher"" the logic of the sheet and will then be able to name the cells corresponding to the largest values. This is why this game is called ""target search"" &mdash; participants are using each guess to learn about where the target is, and to search for the highest-value cells.</p><p>Participants are evaluated based on the values of the cells they name. The score is maximized by naming as many cells with as large values as possible. Theoretically, the best possible score would be to find the center of the target on your first try and then only name the highest-value cells, but this is not likely to happen; most participants will experience some trial and error.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/9ce3cc6fb17d9999491f24e92e9b833e44e3fc4a,tasks/summaries/Target Search-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f
Wason's Selection Task,"<h2>Wason's Selection Task</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given a conditional sentence in the form of, ""If X, then Y."" They also see four cards, which have either a letter or a number on the front. The cards are double-sided; those with a letter on the front have a number on the back, and vice versa.</p><p>As an example, imagine that the conditional sentence says the following: ""If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side.""</p><p>Then, imagine that the four cards are:</p><ol><li>D (front), 3 (back)</li><li>3 (front), K (back)</li><li>B (front), 5 (back)</li><li>7 (front), D (back)</li></ol><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to identify which cards, if turned over, would allow the participant to determine if the conditional sentence is true or false. Participants make the selection by clicking on the appropriate cards on the interface.</p><p>Consider the example above: ""If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side.""</p><p>This means that if there is a card with D on one side, and something other than 3 on the other side, it would make the sentence false. Thus, the answer for each card is as follows:</p><ol><li>Card #1: We should select this card; if there is something other than 3 on the back, then the statement would be false.</li><li>Card #2: We should NOT select this card; whether the other side is D or not does not affect the truth of this statement. If it is D, then the statement is true; if it is not D, it is simply neutral evidence and does not disprove the statement.</li><li>Card #3: We should NOT select this card; the statement does not say anything about cards with letters other than D.</li><li>Card #4: We should select this card; if there is a D on the back, then the statement would be false (since D would be paired with a number other than 3).</li></ol><p>Selecting Card #1 is an easy decision: since it has a D on the front, it is easy to see that we should check for a 3 on the other side. However, some of the other choices are more difficult and require skillfully applying logic: for example, participants may not notice that they need to check Card #4 to make sure there is not a D on the other side. Participants may also mistakenly choose cards #2 or #3.</p><p>For a given sentence, there is a single correct solution (in the example above, choosing both #1 and #4). If participants correctly select exactly the right cards, then they solve the task correctly. If they do not select enough cards (e.g., picking #1 without picking #4) or if they select too many cards (e.g., picking #1, #2, and #4), then they fail the task.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/4cc6b7fdc8d7a4e89498919cce7f441cbff6c5f5,tasks/summaries/Wason's Selection Task-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f
Ravens Matrices,"<h2>Ravens Matrices</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are presented with a pattern, which looks like a matrix or grid with a white background.

In the first space they see a square, divided into four pieces, with one piece colored in. Then, in the second space, there is a square with two of four pieces colored in. In the third space, there is a square with three of four pieces colored in. After the first three steps in the pattern, there would be a blank space on the grid.</p><p>Participants would then see a few multiple-choice options for what could fill the blank space. For example, they could choose between a square with one, two, three, or four pieces filled in.</p><p>All participants working together see the same pattern.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to complete the pattern by identifying what the missing piece should be. </p><p>In the example above, the correct answer is that the fourth space should have a square with four pieces colored in. (That is, successful participants would notice that the first square had one piece colored in; the second had two colored in; the third had three colored in; so, naturally, the fourth should have four colored in.)</p><p>The problem is multiple-choice, so participants will choose just one correct answer from a variety of options.

Participants know nothing about the hidden function; they only see the text box.</p><p>When participants enter numbers into the text box, the system will give them feedback about the value of the function at that point. For example, suppose that the hidden function is y = -x<sup>2</sup> and the participant enters 2. Then the system will tell them that the value is -4, since this is the value of -x<sup>2.</sup> If the participant enters -5, the system will tell them that the value is -25.</p><p>As they make guesses, participants see a log, which shows their guesses so far, the feedback they previously received, and how many guesses they have remaining.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to correctly guess the maximum value of the hidden function after a limited number of guesses (for which there is feedback after each guess).</p><p>Every problem has an objectively correct answer &mdash; the mathematical maximum of that function. However, participants are not told that they have found the correct answer even when they submit it as their guess. For example, if the hidden function is y = -x<sup>2,</sup> the correct answer is 0. A participant who submits 0 will simply be told that the value of the function at that point is also 0; they will not be told that this is the true maximum. Instead, the participant will just get their fixed number of tries, after which they are required to submit their final guess.</p><p>Participants are scored based on how close their final guess is to the true maximum.

The beer game,"<h2>The beer game</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are assigned to a group of four, in which each player has a different role: (1) retailer, (2) wholesaler, (3) distributor, and (4) factory. Customer demand (in kegs of beer) arises only at the retailer, which replenishes its inventory from the wholesaler; the wholesaler gets its beer from the distributor; and the distributor gets its beer from the factory, which produces the beer. The customer demand in different periods is a random variable, independently drawn from a distribution that is known to all players. The beer flows upstream to downstream (i.e. from the factory, to the distribution center, to the warehouse, and finally to the retail store). In contrast, the information about the customers' orders flows in the opposite direction (it goes from the retail store back up to the factory). Both the material and information flows are subject to delays. For example, there is an order processing delay, or information lead time, between when an order is placed and when the supplier receives the order.</p><p>Here is an example. Suppose the retail store orders 10 kegs from the warehouse on Monday. The warehouse receives this order on Wednesday. This information delay is due to the administrative steps in processing an order. On Wednesday, however, the warehouse only has 5 kegs of beer, so it ships 5 kegs to the retail store and backlogs the remaining 5. This shipment of 5 kegs arrives at the retail store on Friday. This delay is due to transportation.</p><p>In each period, the channel members must decide how much, if any, beer to order from their respective suppliers. The factory must decide how much, if any, beer to produce.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>Participants are instructed that their goal is to minimize the total holding and backorder costs incurred in the entire supply chain and optimize the system-wide performance. In other words, the goal is to for each member to choose the right amount of beer to order or produce, despite the lag in information. If participants get the number wrong, they suffer a penalty. If they have too much beer, the wholesaler, distributor, and factory suffer a ""holding cost,"" because it is expensive to store the extra inventory. If they have too little beer, the retailer suffers a ""backorder cost,"" because it is expensive to lose customers when the store does not have the beer people want. In an ideal world, if the entire supply chain operates perfectly smoothly, the cost incurred would be zero.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/50e0c16dc1466066a1904dab1a94750ec12bf398,tasks/summaries/The beer game-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f

Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the buyer, the CFO of BioPharm, or the seller, the CFO of Seltek. BioPharm needs to either buy or build a plant to produce a genetically engineered antibiotic compound called Depox. Depox is a promising pharmaceutical product, and BioPharm needs a plant with special manufacturing equipment. There are two choices for BioPharm: (1) build a new plant; (2) buy a plant that is already set up to manufacture genetically engineered compounds. For this second option, Seltek seems like an ideal ""turnkey"" facility. BioPharm possesses public information about Seltek, including previous appraisal value, accounting statements, and so on. Meanwhile, Seltek is a medium-sized pharmaceutical company that (unbeknownst to BioPharm) has been struggling financially, and it is desperate to sell both the plant and the patent for its chemical compound.

In other words, Biopharm should buy the plant for as low a price as possible, and Seltek should sell the plant for as high a price as possible. Since each side possesses different information, participants must strategically share (or choose to withhold) what they know in order to get a good deal. For example, if Seltek divulges the information that they are desperate to sell, they would likely obtain a much lower price than if they did not divulge such information.</p><p>There are two possible outcomes of the negotiation: either the two parties reach some consensus (to sell the plant at an agreed-upon price) or they are unable to reach an agreement, and BioPharm must build a new plant instead (a costly option).</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/d39293835007ef81174cc6d39b505afb9dbab506,tasks/summaries/Biopharm Seltek-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f

Player 1 is told to send a message to Player 2 about two options for winning different payoffs. The two possible messages are: ""Option A will earn you more money than Option B"" and ""Option B will earn you more money than Option A"". Player 1 can choose to tell the truth or to lie to Player 2, and Player 2 can choose to heed or to ignore the advice of Player 1. The choice of the receiver will determine the payments of both players in the experiment.</p><p>Here is a concrete example. Suppose that the true options are: (Option A) Player 1 gets $5 and Player 2 gets $6; (Option B) Player 1 gets $6 and Player 2 gets $5. </p><p>Player 1 will see the true options, and they can either choose to tell Player 2 the truth (saying, ""Option A will earn you more money than Option B"") or lie (saying, ""Option B will earn you more money than Option A""). If they tell the truth, and Player 2 listens to them, then Player 1 will end up with less money in the end ($5 rather than $6). On the other hand, if they lie, they can potentially influence Player 2 to (unknowingly) choose the option that is better for Player 1. Meanwhile, because Player 2 knows that Player 1 may be lying, they can choose to either follow the advice or to ignore it. In the end, both players receive the payoffs from Player 2's choice, but Player 2 is not informed of how much Player 1 received (so they do not ever find out whether they were ""correct"" or not.)</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, Player 1 must decide which message will lead to Player 2's choosing an advantageous outcome; Player 2 must decide whether or not to trust Player 1, so that they can obtain their own advantageous outcome. Participants are given a limited amount of time (e.g., 10 minutes) to send a message and make a decision.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/1b78987a99f2478c81a7cbfbc806d2707eba2931,tasks/summaries/Sender-Receiver game-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/ee55e7a85cb89eba40c35130fb466de11fda7a3f

Members of the group are given a limited amount of time (e.g. two minutes) to make an investment decision. Individual earnings are $1 in the event that no one invests before the end of the game. Once one group member makes the investment, the round ends. The individual making the investment secures payment of $1.25, while the other two group members each receive $2. The investor is randomly determined in the event that multiple parties simultaneously invest. Participants are not allowed to communicate with other group members in any way.</p><br><h2>2.

It means that one goal is to maximize their personal earnings, which means that they should not invest anything; rather, they should wait for others to invest. But another goal is to optimize the group's outcomes, which means that at least one person in the group should invest.

Public goods game,"<h2>Public goods game</h2><br><h2>1.

The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less than the number of players, N) and this ""public good"" payoff is evenly divided among players. Each participant also keeps the tokens they do not contribute.</p><p>Here is an example to help you imagine what the game might look like. A group of four players participates in this game and starts with $20 in hand. Three players contribute their full $20 while the fourth chooses to contribute $0. The $60 is multiplied by a factor of 1.2 and the resulting $72 is distributed equally among the four players (this means everyone gets $18 from the pot). In this scenario, the three players contributing the most end the round with $18, while the fourth player gets as much as $38 (they kept their initial $20, and earned an additional $18).</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>Participants are instructed that their goal is to maximize their individual payoff as well as the group’s total payoff. It means that one goal is to maximize their personal earnings, which means that they should not invest anything, and simply ""free ride"" off of the others, as in the above example. But another goal is to optimize the group’s outcomes, which means that everyone should contribute all of their tokens to the public pool. If everyone in the example had contributed their full $20, then there would have been $80 in the pool, and each player would be able to take home $24.

Best job candidate (hidden-profile),"<h2>Best job candidate (hidden-profile)</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants read information about three candidates who supposedly had applied for an assistant professorship. Each candidate's profile included positive, neutral, and negative characteristics, and the characteristics are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (negative) to 7 (positive). Not all information, however, is shared among group members. The information is distributed to create a hidden profile. For example, each group member knows only two of candidate A's six positive characteristics, and only one of candidate B's negative characteristics. For candidate C, they knew only one positive and one negative characteristic. Thus, based on the shared information, candidate B seemingly has more positive and fewer negative characteristics and therefore would be the preferred candidate. Only by exchanging information through group discussion could the group members detect the best alternative, candidate A.</p><br><h2>2.

Aerospace Investment (Role-playing),"<h2>Aerospace Investment (Role-playing)</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are randomly paired for a scored negotiation over a venture capital investment. Each person is randomly assigned the role of either the venture capitalist investor or the founder of the aerospace company. Both individuals are scored on their ability to negotiate favorable investment terms for themselves and on the quality of the relationship they develop with their potential business partner. Each negotiator's Total Score is a sum of Substantive Points, awarded according to the agreed-upon terms of the investment, and Process Points, awarded according to each partner's perception of the negotiation process.</p><p>Specifically, each negotiable term of the investment is quantified as specific point values. After the term sheet has been agreed upon, participants independently fill out questionnaires that ask them to evaluate each other on five attributes to determine the amount of Process Points they are awarded. The five process attributes are: trust, respect, equitability, regard for the other's interests, and interest in future collaboration. These attributes serve as proxies for assessing the future of the business relationship based on their experiences during the negotiation.</p><br><h2>2.

Battle of the sexes,"<h2>Battle of the sexes</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are randomly paired with a different anonymous opponent for a predetermined number of decision-making rounds. In each round, both players must make a decision. The final outcome for the players is determined by the decision of both parties.</p><p>Throughout the rounds, the players have access to a shared table that displays the possible outcomes, depending on each player's decision. For example, suppose that each player has 3 options. Then the rows might represent Player 1's options, and the columns might represent Player 2's options. There would be 3x3 = 9 possible outcomes, and the 9 cells of the table would contain the number of points that the players would earn based on their choices. For example, if Player 1 chooses their first option and Player 2 chooses their second option, then the final outcome would be determined by the number of points listed in row 1, column 2.</p><p>Some outcomes are better than others. Thus, in order to get a better outcome, players have the option to use non-binding one-way communication to signal that they may choose a particular row or column, so that the other player can attempt to coordinate. The process of communication is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>The participant is asked if they would like to make an announcement. They may select either yes or no.</p></li><li><p>If they select yes, they will be asked what they would like to announce. They may select any of the actions that will be available to them during the decision-making period (for example, ""I intend to selection option 2"").

Objective / Goal</h2><p>Each participant has the goal of maximizing their own earnings. In the dictator role, participants must decide how much they will offer (from $0 to the full endowment). Since the dictator knows that the receiver cannot reject the offer, it is in the dictator's interest to give the receiver nothing ($0), because they would then keep the full amount.</p><p>However, there are a few reasons why dictators may choose to give more than $0. Giving nothing may conflict with social norms (because the dictator would then be seen as self-serving), or simply feel morally ""unjust."" If there is more than one round being played, dictators may worry that their relationship and reputation with their partner may be harmed in later rounds.

Participants are told that their group is competing with the other group to see which one ""invests"" the most money. The winning group receives a larger cash prize.</p><p>Every individual player in the group must make an independent decision to either invest their personal endowment or keep it for themselves. The group wins or loses depending on the number of players that chose to invest relative to the other group. For example, if everyone in Group A invests and no one in Group B invests, Group A would win the entire cash prize and split it among its members. If some people from both groups invest, but more people from Group A invest than people from Group B, then the two groups would split the cash prize (but Group A would get more of it). Finally, if the same number of people in Groups A and B invest (a tie), then the two groups would split the cash prize 50-50.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>Each participant's goal is to maximize their own payoff. Therefore, when making a decision, participants have to weigh up the cost of losing their individual endowment with the expected gain from splitting the cash prize if their group wins. Since the outcome depends on not only the participant's personal choice, but also the choices of all other players, there is a substantial amount of uncertainty and risk. For example, a participant could choose to invest, only to find that their group has lost (not enough other players invested), and they end up with less money than when they started.
