Something like, &quot;find the best teams under the constraints,&quot; combined with a list of how much &quot;utility&quot; people get from being put together, can easily be put into a computer and solved. Similarly, if you&#39;re trying to find the shortest path from Point A to Point B, you can think of this in terms of geometry.<\/li>\n\t<li><u>You can break the problem down into small units of meaning<\/u>:&nbsp;Examples of these units include the alphabet (26 letters), colors (which can be broken down into units of Red, Blue, and Green), or coordinates on a graph (X,Y). An algorithm could use these units of meaning to solve the task. For example, when generating words, the letters are the units. You can imagine an algorithm in which you use &quot;brute force&quot; to find every possible combination of letters that makes a valid word.
