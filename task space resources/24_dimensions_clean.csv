Type 7 (Battle),Can the outcome of this task be described in win/lose terms?,McGrath
Type 8 (Performance),"Does the task have an all-or-nothing outcome? In other words, is it sufficient to just meet a particular standard?",McGrath
Divisible-Unitary,Is it efficient and useful for members of the group to work on discrete parts (or subtasks) of this activity?,Steiner
Maximizing,"Is the goal (or one of the goals) of this task to try to achieve doing something as much as possible, as many as possible, or as quickly as possible?",Steiner
Optimizing,Is the goal (or one of the goals) of this task to try to achieve a precise outcome?,Steiner
Outcome Multiplicity,"Is there only one ""best"" solution (or possible solution) to this task?","Shaw, Zigurs et al."
Solution Scheme Multiplicity,"Is there only one method for achieving the task, as opposed to many alternatives for task completion?","Shaw, Zigurs et al."
Decision Verifiability,"Can acceptable solutions to this task be demonstrated or verified to be correct (e.g., by an expert or third-party)?",Laughlin and Ellis
Shared Knowledge,"Can this task be written as a ""formal model"" that an algorithm could solve?",Laughlin and Ellis
Within-System Solution,Is there enough information in the problem to find a valid solution?,Laughlin and Ellis
Answer Recognizability,"If someone who is able to solve the problem explains their answer, would others recognize it as correct without contest?",Laughlin and Ellis
Time Solvability,"Is a participant able to come up with a provably correct solution, assuming sufficient ability, time, motivation, and resources?",Laughlin and Ellis
Type 3 and Type 4 (Objective Correctness),Is there an objectively correct solution to this task that can be calculated or selected?,McGrath
Intellective-Judgmental,"On a scale of 0 (entirely subjective, with no correct answer; a judgmental task) to 1 (entirely objective and demonstrable by pure logic; an intellective task), how would you classify the extent of demonstrable correctness of this task?",Laughlin and Ellis
Conflicting Tradeoffs,Does completing this task require participants to evaluate tradeoffs --- conflicting possible solutions or conflicting pieces of information?,Zigurs et al.
Solution Scheme Outcome Uncertainty,"When doing this task, will the participants have any uncertainty about whether their method or solution will lead to the desired outcome?",Zigurs et al.
Eureka Question,"Is the solution to the question obvious as soon as it is proposed --- for example, once people see the ""trick,"" they know how to solve it?",Laughlin and Ellis
