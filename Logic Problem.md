# Summary
> >This task examined how different coordination demands and how individual contributations could be combined into a group product. To do this, participants performed anagram and logic tasks.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
>Three variations of each type of task was used to prevent subjects in one group from communicating to another group

# Procedure
## Steps
> Randomly assign participants to work alone or in groups of 2, 5, or 10.
> 
> First, participants will complete 33 anagrams randing from 5 to 14 letters in 5 minutes
> 
> Then, participants with complete a logic problem by compiling information among the different group members and make 15 deductions to arrive at a solution in 25 minutes.
> > An example of a logic problem:
> > > 1. Pair first and last names with destinations to determine which five couples vacationed at various ski resorts
> > > 2. Clues include: "Neither Tammy nor Sue vacationed in Innsbruck," and Both Rita and Mrs. Owens returned from their vacations with broken wrists."
> 
> After each task, subjects completed a questionnaire describing group processes and their reaction to the task

## Roles 
>All participants had the same role

## Instructions
ASK

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
>The anagram was scored based on the number of anagrams solved
>The logic problem was scored based on the number of critical facts correctly deduced 

## Incentives
>None listed
