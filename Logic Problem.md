## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
>Three variations of each type of task was used to prevent subjects in one group from communicating to another group

# Procedure
## Steps
> Randomly assign participants to work alone or in groups of 2, 5, or 10.
> First, participants will complete 33 anagrams randing from 5 to 14 letters in 5 minutes
> Then, participants with complete a logic problem by compiling information among the different group members and make 15 deductions to arrive at a solution in 25 minutes.
> After each task, subjects completed a questionnaire describing group processes and their reaction to the task

## Roles 
>All participants had the same role

## Instructions
ASK

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
>The anagram was scored based on the number of anagrams solved
>The logic problem was scored based on the number of critical facts correctly deduced 

## Incentives
>None listed
