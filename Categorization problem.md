# Stimuli
## The visual components
> Document or generate the visual stimuli seen by participants when performing this task. Provide screenshots or illustrations.

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
> If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  
> In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps
> Step one: Group members arrived, introduced themselves, and were given name tags. They were made aware that they would be video recorded.
> 
> Step two: Students were provided with a set of verbal instructions and clarifications as required.
> 
> Step three: The students were asked not to disclose any information to their classmates during the three weeks of the study.
> 
> Step four: The first training session used stimulus 1. In this training, cards were initially distributed such that each individual was provided with two identical cards to provide a hint on how to form card categories (i.e., one item per card used as the basis for
  grouping). All participants were allowed to see each others cards. They were allowed to ask questions and the experimenter provided them with feedback on the correct categories during the training sections
>
> Step five: During the second training session, the experimenter introduced a barrier across the table (a wooden cross of about 48 inches long for each slab and 12 inches high). The barrier allowed subjects to see one another and exchange cards easily, but 
 prevented them from seeing one anothers cards. Participants had homogeneous but non-identical cards. They had to describe their cards in order to find out what other group members had,
> 
> Step six: Each individual was told they would receive up to three bonus marks in the course for their participation. They were told they would receive half a mark for each of the three experiments if they individually were able to come up with four of a kind, and half a mark per experiment if every other member of the group was also able 
to come up with their 4 of a kind. They could receive 0 marks if they did not get four of a kind in any of the three conditions, 1.5 marks if they got four of a kind on all three conditions, and the full 3 marks if they and
the other members of the group got four of a kind on all three conditions.

> Step seven: 
## Roles 
> A description of roles if relevant to the task.  
> If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions
> Instructions
1. You will be performing three experiments and each completed experiment earns a
bonus mark of one point.
2. These experiments comply with the UW ethics and research guidelines. All data
collected will be used solely for research purposes. The films and videotapes will
only be used in support of data analysis and during paper presentation(s) at
research conferences.
3. 16 cards will be distributed equally among the 4 participants
4. The objective of this experiment is for each of you to come up with 4 cards of a
kind. I will demonstrate this using the sample cards in front of you. The solution
will be four cards of the same color. This is a much simpler version of the actual
experiments to demonstrate the basic task.
5. You get half a mark if you get a group of 4 and you get a full mark if everyone on
the group forms a group of 4 each.
6. There would be time limits for each task, 5 minutes for the first, 10 minutes for
the second and 15 minutes for the third task.
7. Each participant will be required to fill a short questionnaire after each task.
8. Pls. exchange/trade cards but do not take over other subjects cards.
Thank you for your time and participation.
Good Luck 
# Criteria
## Performance calculation
> A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  
> Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  
> This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 

## Incentives
>  The graduate students were paid for their participation while the undergraduate students (excluding one) were compensated with three bonus marks in an organizational behaviour undergraduate course.
