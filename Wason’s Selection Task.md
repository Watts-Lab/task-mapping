# Summary
Two experiments were carried out to investigate the difficulty of making the contrapositive inference from conditional sentences of the form, “if P then Q.” This inference, that not-P follows from not-Q, requires the transformation of the information presented in the conditional sentence.

# Stimuli
## The visual components

*Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity*

Two conditional sentences were typed on separate cards (5 x 3 in.):
(1) “If there is a D on one side of any card, then there is a 3 on its other side.” 
(2) “If there is a 3 on one side of any card, then there is a D on its other side.”

Four cards (2 x 2 in.) associated with the two sentences (1)(2) had the following letters and numbers on their front and (in brackets) on their back:
(1) D(3), 3(K), B(5), 7(D)
(2) 3(D), K(3), 5(B), D(7)

*Experiment 2 - The restricted Contingency programme*

Two conditional sentences were typed on separate cards similar to those used in Experiment I. 
(1) “If there is a square on one side of the card, then there is a red scribble on the other side.” 
(2) “If there is a red scribble on one side of a card, then there is a square on the other side.” 

Four programme cards were prepared for the experimental group which had the following stimuli on either side: 
(a) square, yellow scribble
(b) square, red scribble 
(c) rectangle, red scribble 
(d) hexagon, brown scribble 

Eight similar cards were prepared for the selection task, the items mentioned first being on the front of the cards, and the items mentioned second (in brackets) being on the back: 
(a) square (red scribble) 
(b) square (brown scribble) 
(c) red scribble (square) 
(d) red scribble (hexagon) 
(e) green scribble (rectangle) 
(f) parellelogram (yellow scribble)
(g) triangle (red scribble)
(h) blue scribble (square)

## Materials for alternative versions of the experiment 
If the task has multiple versions based on changing stimuli (e.g. the set of eyes in RME), if possible, provide a complete set, or a specification of the rules for generating that set. For example, in the RME task, provide all of the eye images, and a table of terms.  

In the case that the complete set is not possible, provide enough unique examples that the reference version of the task experiment could be completed. If there are various levels of the task, e.g., in Sudoku, include a similarly sized sample of each level.

# Procedure
## Steps

Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity

The subjects were allocated alternately to the groups and tested individually.
Half the subjects in each group were tested with sentence (I) and half with sentence (2). The sentence was placed on the desk and the four test cards were placed in a line in a random order face upwards in front of the sentence. The subjects were told that cards with letters on their front had numbers on their back and vice uersa. In the selection task the experimenter pointed to each card in turn and asked the subject whether knowing what was on the other side would enable him to find out whether the sentence was true or false. During the projection of falsity, in the experimental group, the experimenter pointed to each card and asked the subject to name a letter (or number) on the other side which would make the sentence false, or to say “none,” if none would do so.



## Roles 

Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity

If relevant, describe how roles are assigned and used in the task. List all roles and list how the experience for each role differs from others.

## Instructions

Experiment 1 - The projection of falsity

Complete instructions shown to participants at each stage of the task.  

Write the complete instructions used from the start to the end of the experiment. This should include any instruction provided on each of the steps. If instructions have step interdependence, or are role specific, describe that in full detail.

If the instructions are not available ask the paper's authors, however and if that fails, write new ones that appear as suitable as possible.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
A formal specification of how performance is evaluated based on the specific materials and the teams actions in a given trial.  

Write out how performance is calculated for this task. There may be more than one performance metric, and in that case, list all the ones used in the reference papers. These could be simple metrics, e.g., completion time in Sudoku, while others may involve an equation, a key (e.g., RME), or an algorithm, to judge the correct answer.  

This likely does not reflect details of the results of the paper but instead just how the task was designed and measured. 

## Incentives
A formal specification of the incentives for participation.   

Write how participants are incentivized (payments, or other incentives) and how these incentives are calculated for the task.
