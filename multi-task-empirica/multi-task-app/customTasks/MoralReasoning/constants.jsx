    case: "So my mom and da divorced some time ago, and my mom has since started dating again and now wants to get married to her boyfriend.\n\r\n\rThe problem is that the date she set for the wedding is the exact day my birthday is on. AITA (Am I the asshole) for being angry about this? And keep in mind that this would not be over next year, since my birthday would then forever be her wedding anniversary, which I'd play second fiddle to. WIBTA (Would I be the asshole) for not attending the wedding for these reasons?",

    case: "I (23F) was out with my boyfriend (24M) and some of his work friends at a bar last night. One of his work friends I had never met came out and we started talking. This is a kid friendly bar and the topic of kids came up. I do not want kids and do not have any. My boyfriends work friend said she has 2 kids and I jokingly said \"my condolences.\"\n\r\n\r I could tell at the time she didn't think it was funny, but the subject changed and it was never brought up again. This morning my boyfriend gets a text basically saying my joke upset her and she didn't say anything last night because she respects my boyfriend and didn't want to cause trouble. But she never wants to hang out with me again and wants to be warned when I will be coming out so she knows not to come.\n\r\n\rI genuinely do feel bad I upset her and made her feel unwelcome in her social circle. She has been complaining to my boyfriend that she doesn't have any friends and wants to hang out with that group more. I know I messed up but am I an asshole?",

    case: "My wife (28f) and I (30m) had a baby who is now 3 months old. When we were trying to conceive, her dad (83m) had 2 massive strokes that have now left him bed ridden, with very limited use of his legs and his arms, due to all that, plus his age, we are fairly certain this will be the last grandchild he will know (the rest of her siblings have no interest in having kids any time soon).\n\r\n\rWhen we found out were having a boy, we decided to name him after her dad, Jackson, with 2 middle names after my own dad (James and Robert). \n\r\n\rWhen we told my parents the name, my dad showed his dislike for it, and suggested his own name, we explained that we were naming him after my wife's dad, but that his middle names would be after him, he seemed annoyed but didn't bring it up again.\n\r\n\rWhen our son was born, everyone called him Jackson, except my dad, who refers to him as JR (his own initials). My wife didn't say anything at first, and I didn't think too much of it. Now that our baby has gotten a bit bigger, she has actually expressed her annoyance in it to me, and said we should say something to my dad, as my wife finds it disrespectful. I admit I was taken back, as I don't think it that big of a deal as it is his grandson as well, and he should be able to call him what he wants. My wife got a little upset and said that our sons name means something to her, and that she will express so to my dad herself. I told her not to cause drama over something so small, and to move on from the fact that my dad will refer to our son as JR. She is now hurt that I am brushing off something important to her, but I honestly don't think it be worth what the outcome will probably be. AITA (Am I the asshole)?",

    case: "I met my wife in my early 30s. She was in her mid 20s at the time. I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage.\n\r\n\rSo when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.\n\r\n\rSo she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.\n\r\n\rA couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. Divorced obviously followed.\n\r\n\rThe only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country.\n\r\n\rNow if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I'd have no problem paying what's fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent.\n\r\n\rSo in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, > 90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.\n\r\n\rSo here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.\n\r\n\rNow she has no legal recourse (I've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.\n\r\n\rThe reason I'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",
