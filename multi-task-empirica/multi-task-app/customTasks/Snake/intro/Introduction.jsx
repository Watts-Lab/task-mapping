        Snake is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades
        becoming something of a classic. It became the standard pre-loaded game
        on Nokia phones in 1998.

        The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which
        roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item),
        trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area.
        Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making
        the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the
        snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows.
