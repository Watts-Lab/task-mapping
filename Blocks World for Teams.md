# Summary
This studied examined the communication among teams by having teams of four people search for and deliver a specified series of colored blocks as quickly as possible.

>Low-complexity task
>> Participants were required to collect six blue-colored blocks
>
>Medium-complexity task
>> Participants were required to search for and deliver 16 blocks, which were divided into two sequences that could be collected in parallel. One sequence called for pink- and green-colored blocks in alternating order, while the other required white and blue blocks in alternating order. Each of the four team members was assigned a specific color.
>> 
>> In one of the two medium-complexity tasks, it incorporated a “communication failure” in which two of the four agents were unable to communicate with each other for a prespecified duration within the task.
>>
>High-complexity task
>> Participants were required to collect six blocks in a random sequence of colors that was predetermined during the experiment design phase

# Stimuli
## The visual components
>The environment contained nine rooms, designated A1 through C3, with each room containing colored blocks. A 10th room, designated the “drop zone,” was located at the bottom of the map. There were also hallways allowing the participants to travel from room to room.
>
>Each participant could only see the blocks in the room he or she was currently occupying, including the drop zone. Participants were also unable to see the locations of their teammates; however, when another agent was occupying an adjacent room, the door to that room was colored red; otherwise, it was colored green
>
>To communicate with each other the BW4T interface included a large chat window and a set of predetermined communications to facilitate this interaction: “Ask,” “Question,” “Tell,” and “Relay.” The participants then had to select who the message was for, whether it was about a room or a block, and then further describe it using the predetermined options.
>
>To know what was in the block zone the participants either had to visit the block zome or communicate to each other

# Procedure
## Steps
> Each participant was given an introduction to the study, an informed
consent form first. Next, participants completed an initial survey to document participant
demographics
> 
> They were placed at computers with large boards between all four of them. They were asked to remain silent for the duration of the game.
>  
> They then received an introduction to the study, an informed consent form, and an overview of the BW4T display. 
> 
> They completed three training rounds, each which took about 10 minutes. Participants practiced variations of the low-, medium-, and high-complexity tasks.
> 
> Next, a total of four tasks were executed by the team: one low-complexity task, one high-complexity task, and two medium-complexity tasks. The order of the tasks was randomized
>>Participants then had to look below the drop zone to see the desired sequence of colored blocks. They then had to work together to deliver the specified colored blocks to the drop zone.
>>
>> If the participant delivered a block into the drop zone that was not of the requested color, this incorrect block was automatically and randomly placed into one of the other nine rooms.
>> 
>> After each task, a subjective questionnaire was administered in order to obtain feedback on participants’ perceived workload, stress, and degree of trust in their teammates.

## Roles 
>The experimenter's screen had an overview of all of the rooms

## Instructions
ASKED AND WAITING FOR REPLY

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
The team’s performance while completing the task was measured in terms of completion time. A low completiion time indicated high team performance. 

## Incentives
Each participant received a $10 monetary compensation for their participation in the experiment. An additional monetary incentive of $40 was provided for the team with fastest completion time across all performed tasks.
