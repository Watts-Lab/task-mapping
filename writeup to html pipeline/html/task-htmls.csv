Euclidean traveling salesperson,"<h2>Euclidean traveling salesperson</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different “paths” by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a “path” between A and B. All participants, who are working on individual screens, are shown a shared map of the cities and can click and interact with it simultaneously.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to find and select the precise shortest path through the cities within a fixed amount of time. This is the sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a “traveling salesman” who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant’s goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.</p><p>Participants are evaluated on how close the path they found was to the optimal shortest path. They will be able to see the length of the current path they found, but they will not be told that they have reached the optimum.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/1ee576644bfaee5f592166b550ed34db1428bc69,tasks/summaries/Euclidean traveling salesperson-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e6f0483e3755c51519cd0528c68f77deb41a1543

Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given instructions to map letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J, which have been initially randomly assigned without replacement, to one of the 10 digits (0 through 9). For example, because letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; maps onto digit &ldquo;3&rdquo; and letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; maps onto digit &ldquo;5&rdquo;, an operation &ldquo;A + B&rdquo; would correspond to &ldquo;3 + 5&rdquo;. If letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; would map onto digit &ldquo;8&rdquo;, then A + B = C.</p><br><h2>2.

Participants must also get the correct answer as quickly as possible.</p><p>There is a specific process participants have to follow to map letters onto numbers. Participants are first asked to come up with addition or subtraction operation (e.g., &ldquo;A + B&rdquo;) and then given an answer in the letter form (e.g., &ldquo;A + B = C&rdquo;). Then participants propose a mapping for a letter (e.g., &ldquo;A = 3&rdquo;) and receive feedback (e.g., &ldquo;True, A = 3&rdquo;). Participants have to follow this process in proposing the mapping of all letters to all digits. To submit their final answer, participants have to indicate which digits each of the letters correspond to.</p><p>Participants are evaluated based on several criteria, such as the number of trials they used, letters identified per trial, and letters used per equation.

Search for Oil Task,"<h2>Search for Oil Task</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Pariticipants view a shared 12x12 grid of points, creating a digital &ldquo;map&rdquo;. Each point represents a section of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in a theoretical oil field. A limited number of these points have been pre-determined by the makers of the game to contain &ldquo;oil,&rdquo; while others contain nothing. </p><p>Participants are also given some information about which points might be more likely (but not certain!) to contain the oil. For example, they are told that some parts of this grid represent land with the appropriate chemical composition, making it more probable that there will be oil there. (Other pieces of information that make oil more or less likely include information about the surface hardness, surface mantle thickness, and geological stratification of the area.)</p><p>After being shown the detailed information for a limited amount of time, participants have to remember as much information as they can and then decide where they want to &ldquo;drill&rdquo; completely from memory. During the main gameplay, participants see just the 12x12 map, where they are able to click on each point if they want to drill there.</p><p>As participants select which locations they want to drill, they are given feedback after each decision. For example, after participants pick a point on the 12x12 grid to drill oil, they will be told whether they were right or wrong about oil being there, and they will see the running total of their score.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal of the task is to decide which of the 144 sections of land is suitable for drilling oil, and to do so as accurately as possible before the game&#39;s time limit runs out. In other words, participants have to remember and account for all the information they were provided about where oil is most likely to be found, and then decide where they want to &ldquo;drill&rdquo; (by clicking on the point on the map).</p><p>Participants aim to get the highest possible score, and they earn points for every location with oil that they successfully find. They lose points if they select locations that do not have oil. Therefore, one would get the maximum score of this game by correctly finding every point with oil without making any mistakes.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/6d3cc0d689bfc7f7ae069f983a92debe79c5a8fc,tasks/summaries/Search for Oil Task-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e6f0483e3755c51519cd0528c68f77deb41a1543
"Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer","<h2>Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants are given a problem that reads as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. On his way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only himself and a single one of his purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.</p><p>If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.</p><p>The farmer&#39;s challenge was to carry himself and his purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did he do it?&rdquo;</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to achieve the fewest number of trips that get the wolf, goat, and cabbage from one river bank to another, and to solve this problem within the time limit.</p><p>There are a few different possible solutions that get to the lowest number. All of the solutions require the participants take the goat over first, because any other action will lead to something being eaten. Once the farmer comes back, though, there is a dilemma, because if he takes the wolf over, the wolf would eat the goat on the other side; if he takes the cabbage over, the goat would eat the cabbage on the other side.</p><p>The &ldquo;trick&rdquo; to this problem is to realize that the farmer can actually take the goat BACK on his return trip: that is, he takes either the wolf or cabbage with him on the second trip. Then, he takes the goat BACK to the ORIGINAL side. He then picks up the remaining one of the cabbage or wolf, and finally, he goes back with the goat. Realizing that you can actually bring things back and forth (in both directions), rather than just in one direction across the river, usually requires some out-of-the-box thinking.</p><p>Therefore, participants must satisfy the constraints of the problem while also thinking creatively. As a final piece of helpful context, this task is actually a well-known one that many people have built algorithms to solve.</p><p>To summarize, the solution to this task is:</p><ol><li>Take the goat to the other side</li><li>Return to original side (where the wolf and cabbage are)</li><li>Take either the wolf or cabbage to the other side</li><li>Return to the original side with the goat [THIS IS THE TRICK! Realizing this prevents either the wolf eating the goat or the goat eating the cabbage.]</li><li>Take the cabbage or wolf over to the other side</li><li>Return to the original side, where only the goat remains.</li><li>Take the goat over</li></ol>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/b9d60e8325c43f3284c5844b42d8fce986f71934,"tasks/summaries/Wolf, goat and cabbage transfer-writeup.md",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/e6f0483e3755c51519cd0528c68f77deb41a1543
