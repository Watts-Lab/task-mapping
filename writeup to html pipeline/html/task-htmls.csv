Euclidean traveling salesperson,"<h2>Euclidean traveling salesperson</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants get a map with multiple cities, which are displayed as dots on the screen. These dots can be connected by different “paths” by clicking on two dots one after the other. For example, clicking on point A, then point B, would draw a “path” between A and B. All participants, who are working on individual screens, are shown a shared map of the cities and can click and interact with it simultaneously.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to find and select the precise shortest path through the cities within a fixed amount of time. This is the sequence of cities corresponding to the shortest possible path to traverse through all of the cities, forming a cycle (or loop). In other words, the participant should click through the dots in a sequence, thus drawing a path that touches every city exactly once, and the first city twice: you can think of it as a “traveling salesman” who visits each city on the map before returning to his home city. Imagine that the shortest path involves going from A, to B, to C, to D. In that example, the participant’s goal would be to find this path, and then click the cities in that order: A, B, C, D, A.</p><p>Participants are evaluated on how close the path they found was to the optimal shortest path. They will be able to see the length of the current path they found, but they will not be told that they have reached the optimum.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/1ee576644bfaee5f592166b550ed34db1428bc69,tasks/summaries/Euclidean traveling salesperson-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/9b619333338fff4384c50ada1ec782a52381a920
Moral Reasoning (Disciplinary Action Case),"<h2>Moral Reasoning (Disciplinary Action Case)</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants read a fictitious, controversial case in which a college basketball player bribed an instructor to change his grade on an exam in order to maintain his eligibility on the team.</p><p>Participants are also given a list of potential actions that the college could take in response, in which the student and/or instructor could be given a punishment or consequence.

To evacuate or not to evacuate,"<h2>To evacuate or not to evacuate</h2><br><h2>1. Set-Up</h2><p>Participants read about a situation in which &#39;a disaster may or may not strike.&#39; They are given information about the risk level of the disaster, as well as a button to &ldquo;evacuate&rdquo; from the disaster. </p><p>Evacuating from the disaster costs money &mdash; participants lose half their bonus if they choose to evacuate. However, if they don&#39;t evacuate and the disaster happens, then they lose their entire bonus. Therefore, this task is about weighing up the different risks and rewards of clicking the &ldquo;evacuate&rdquo; button.</p><p>Participants only find out whether the disaster happened or not at the very end of the game. All participants are equally affected by the disaster, but they make their selection for evacuation individually.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to make a decision regarding whether or not to evacuate. Participants have a limited amount of time to make their decision.</p><p>Choosing NOT to evacuate means that there is high risk (you could get nothing), but potential for a high reward. On the other hand, choosing to evacuate has a low risk but a smaller reward.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/641ecc0c5f0cd7e57f990b7bc10b833b660f2311,tasks/summaries/To evacuate or not to evacuate-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/9b619333338fff4384c50ada1ec782a52381a920

To establish a community arts program featuring art, music, and dance programs for children and adults. (3.) To establish an additional shelter for the homeless in the community.</p><br><h2>2. Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to collectively decide how to allocate $500,000 between three competing programs within the time limit. As each program is designed to appeal to personal values, there is no right, wrong, or optimal way of allocation, and the purpose of the task is to resolve different conflicts in people&#39;s values and interests.</p>",https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/8a13990b67bb3d8e5efc243643b0b59a306e35e6,tasks/summaries/Allocating resources to programs-writeup.md,https://api.github.com/repos/Watts-Lab/task-mapping/git/blobs/9b619333338fff4384c50ada1ec782a52381a920

Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to use the colors given to &ldquo;color&rdquo; the entire network without conflicts. This means that participants need to assign each node in the graph a color, ensuring that no two connected nodes share the same color. Using our social network example, if Person A and Person B are friends (which means they are connected), they cannot be assigned the same color.

The true goal of this task is to find this optimal answer. </p><p>Participants who do not think &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; therefore usually have difficulty completing this task.

Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to give a rating that is as close as possible to how other Americans viewed the product and slogan. The challenge is to be exact in predicting how other Americans think. </p><p>Participants receive points based on how close their ratings are to the &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; The &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is calculated based on the average poll response of 100 American users on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Objective / Goal</h2><p>The goal is to drill as much oil as possible within a fixed amount of time by choosing the dots corresponding to &ldquo;wells&rdquo; that the participant wants to select.
