# Summary
Group members collectively guess coordinates, and the value of the experimenters diagram determines the value of their decision. There were undifferentiated and differentiated power structure conditions.

# Procedure
## Steps
>First, the participants completed a 24-item IP scale which contained items like "In meetings of groups to which I belong I often find myself trying to get things organized" to determine IP tendencies
>
>Then, one member of each group was required to volunteer stand before the group and record on the blackboard the group's decisions. This validated the IP scale.
>
>Paricipants were then assigned to the various groups and conditions in haphazard order.
>
>The group of four is seated infront of a blackboard with a blank diagram with letters on the x-axis and numbers on the y-axis.
>
>Participants are read the instructions.
>
>Paricipants will be given 3 minutes for discussion before making a group decision, then will have 10 trials to choose a coordinate on each of the five problems.
>
>After each decision, they will be told their score based on the diagram.
>
>The highest possible score would be a score of 200, where the group chooses the central coordinate on all 10 trials.
>
>At the end of each problem, the participants could examine the experimenters diagram. They were then asked to complete a questionaire that required ratings of 1. personal satisfaction with the job, 2. group cooperation, and 3. group performance. They were also asked to rank members of the group in order of amount of influence on the group's decisions.

## Roles 
The group has a blank diagram, while the experimenter has a diagram with target values written in. The experimenter marked the groups decision on the blackboard and entered the score earned.

An observer was also persent who sat at one side of the room and unobtrusively recorded selected aspects of the group interaction.

The experimenter and observer separately ranked the participants in order of perceived influence on the group process.

## Instructions
Undifferentiated power structure:
> Each choice will be determined by group discussion. You will be given two minutes to discuess each choice. If you agree before the end of two minutes, we will go on to the next choice. If you do not agree by the end of the discussion period the choice will be the coordinates agreed upon by the largest number of persons. In case of a tie, I will toss a coin to decided which one to accept.

Differentiated power structure:
>Each choice will be made after group discussion. You will be given two minutes to discuss each choice, but if you finish before the end of the disucssion period we will go on to the next choice. The actual decision regarding which coordinates to choose on any given trial will be made by ________. In making the decision he may consider the opinions expressed during the discussion period if he wishes; however, he will have complete and absolute authority to choose any coordinate he wishes, regardless of the opinions of other group members.

# Criteria
## Performance calculation
Total score on 10 trials; number of trials to discover coordinate having highest value.

Participants were also measured by number of suggestions per problem, number of suggestions accepted by the group, observer's ranking of participants influence on group decisions, participant's rating of other participant's influence on group decisions, participant's ratings of satisfaction, participant's ratings of group cooperation, and participant's ratings of group performance.
